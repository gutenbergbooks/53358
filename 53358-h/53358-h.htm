<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Massinger Court</span> in Herefordshire was a grand
old Tudor mansion, the brown sandstone walls and
tiled roofs of which had been a source of pride to
the inhabitants of the county for untold generations.
Standing in a fair estate of ten thousand acres, three
roods, and twenty-eight perches (to be accurate), with
a nominal rental of somewhat over fifteen thousand
a year, it might be thought that for the needs of an
unmarried man of eight and twenty there was "ample
room and verge enough."</p>

<p>Beside the honour and glory of being Massinger
of Massinger, and inhabiting "The Court," the erstwhile
residence of a royal princess, with its priceless
heirlooms and memories!</p>

<p>Many a newly enriched proprietor would have
given his eyes to have possessed them by hereditary
right.</p>

<p>For, consider, what a place, what a possession, it
was!</p>

<p>Thus, many a maid, many a matron of the town
and county, had often reflected in appraising the
matrimonial value of the eligible suitors of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Think of the grand hall, sixty feet in length,
twenty-six in width, extending to the roof with
its fine old oaken rafters and queer post trusses!
Think of the floor of polished oak, the walls with
their priceless oak panelling, with carved frieze and
moulded cornice; the mullioned windows, with
arched openings giving light to King Edward's
corridor on the first floor, carried across one corner
of the hall by the angle gallery!</p>

<p>Then&mdash;glory of glories!&mdash;the bay, ten feet wide
and nine deep, with windows glazed in lead squares,
and extending to the springing of the roof.</p>

<p>Here was a place to sit and dream, while gazing
over the park, in the glowing yet tender light of an
early summer morn, the while the châtelaine tripped
down the broad oaken staircase at the opposite end
of the hall, with its carved grotesque-headed newels.</p>

<p>Boudoir and billiard-room, dining and drawing-room,
library and morning-room, were they not all
there, admirably proportioned, in addition to a score
of other needful, not to say luxurious, apartments?</p>

<p>Thus much for the domestic demesne, the suzerainty
of which is dear to every woman's heart.</p>

<p>From a man's point of view&mdash;at Massinger Moor
were the head keeper's lodge and kennels; these last
slated, with iron caged runs, stone-paved, iron-doored,
complete.</p>

<p>The river Teme is famed for excellent trout-fishing.
Salmon also are not unknown in the water. But, in
this connection be it known, that for centuries past
the lords of the manor have permitted the townspeople
to fly-fish (for trout only) in that length of the river
below the bridge.</p>

      <span class="i1">"And then, her heritage, it goes</span>
      <span class="i2">Along the banks of Tame;</span>
      <span class="i1">In meadows deep the heifer lows,</span>
      <span class="i2">The falconer and woodsman knows</span>
      <span class="i1">Her thickets for the game."</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As much as this might be said for the woods and
coverts of "The Court," since that old time when
"the forest laws were sharp and stern," and the Conqueror
stood no nonsense where "the tall deer that
he loved as his own children" were concerned.</p>

<p>The descendants of these well-beloved and interesting
animals were by no means scarce in "The Chase,"
which was still jealously preserved for them as of old.</p>

<p>The North Herefordshire hounds met three days a
week, the Milverton hounds two days, the Ledbury
were only just across the boundary, while, for fear the
squire and his visitors might feel a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupçon</i> of ennui
in the season, the South Boulton harriers are available,
and, to fill up any conceivable chink, the Dunster
otter-hounds were within easy reach.</p>

<p>Thus, man's every earthly need being provided for,
his spiritual welfare was by no means forgotten.</p>

<p>In the parish church, as was befitting in days of old,
before the doctrine of equality and the "flat burglary"
of democracy were so much as named, was reserved
for the lords of Massinger and their assigns, by sale
or lease, the whole of the south aisle and chapel. And
as the church was within five minutes' walk of the
Court, all pedestrian fatigue, as well as the indecency
of taking out carriages and horses on the Sabbath,
was avoided.</p>

<p>Now, from an earthly paradise like this, why should
the lawful owner, young, good-looking, cultured,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

athletic, think for one moment of fleeing to the desert,
socially, and no doubt literally, of a distant, almost
unknown British colony?</p>

<p>Was there an angel with a flaming sword? If so,
she was typified in the guise of Hypatia Tollemache.
Was she mad?</p>

<p>Must be. He, of course, utterly moonstruck, inasmuch
as there is well known to be throughout all
England a sufficiency of marriageable damsels&mdash;even,
as some have averred, a redundancy of that desirable
national product. If the county had been polled, they
would have voted for a <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>.</p>

<p>Was there a hidden reason? There could not be.</p>

<p>He was not rich, but Massinger had stood many
an extravagant squire in the old days without losing
the estate which had come down from father to son
since the Conquest, and would again so continue to
descend, with a prudent marriage in aid of rent and
relief of mortgages.</p>

<p>But there was a reason besides what lay on the
surface, and the old family lawyer, Mr. Nourse, of
Nourse and Lympett, knew it well. More than a
hundred years ago there had been a sudden-appearing
re-incarnation of one of the most reckless spendthrifts&mdash;and
there had been more than one in the annals
of the family&mdash;that had ever scandalized the county,
frightened the villagers, and wasted like water the
revenues which should have kept up the ancient
traditions of the house.</p>

<p>Rainauld de Massinger had the misfortune to be
a living anachronism. Born out of due time, he was
at odds with the age and the circumstances amidst
which his lot had been cast. Despising the unlettered

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>

squirearchy of his day, and the nearly as
uncongenial nobility of the county, he threw himself
with ardour into the semi-scientific, wholly visionary
studies which, under the name of astrology, amused
the leisure of those personages who could not content
themselves with the dull round of duties and coarse
dissipations which the manners of the age prescribed.
He constructed a laboratory in one of the turret-rooms,
which only he and his confidential servant, a grave,
silent Italian, were suffered to enter. From time to
time mysterious strangers of foreign habit and alien
language arrived at Massinger, and were entertained
with every mark of high respect. The villagers spoke
with awe of midnight fires in the turret-room, of the
strange sounds, the evil-smelling fumes thence proceeding,
with other innovations proper in their
untutored fancies to the occupation of a sorcerer.
Seldom did he visit the Court, and when at rare
intervals his tall figure and dark saturnine face were
remarked in the throng of nobles, they inspired dislike
or distrust more than kindly sentiment. Not that such
feelings were openly displayed. For he had brought
back from his travels in the East, and the far countries
in which he had spent his early manhood, a reputation
for swordsmanship which caused even the reckless
gallants of the day to pause ere they lightly aroused
the ire of one who was known to hold so cheaply his
own life and that of others.</p>

<p>It was known that he had fought as a volunteer in
the long Roumanian war with the Turks, in which
it was popularly reported that he bore a charmed life;
such had been his almost incredible daring, such had
been the miraculous escapes from captivity and torture.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>

And yet, all suddenly relinquishing a career which
promised unusual brilliancy in court and camp, he had
for years shut himself up in the old hall at Massinger,
devoting himself to those unblessed studies which had
excited the distrust of his neighbours, the displeasure
of the Church, the cynical wonder of his peers.</p>

<p>Departing with his usual eccentricity from the course
which he had apparently laid down for himself, he for
a season quitted his lonely studies, once more mingled
in the gaieties of the county, even consented to grace
the revels of royalty with his presence. His manner
at such times was gracious, courtly, and strongly interesting.
Like many men of his character and reputation,
he exercised an almost resistless fascination over
the fairer sex when he chose to enter the lists. It
was so in this instance. He succeeded, in despite of
a host of rivals and the opposition of her parents, in
winning the hand of the beautiful Elinor de Warrenne,
the daughter of a neighbouring baronet of lands and
honours hardly inferior to his own. For a year or
more the gloom which rested on his spirit seemed to
have passed away. Happy in the possession of an
heir, his conduct after marriage put to shame the
ominous predictions of friends and foes. His wife was
fondly attached to him. His stately manners had won
sympathy for her, and the approval of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grandes
dames</i> of the county. He conciliated the tenantry;
the ordinary duties of his station were not neglected.
The happiest results were expected. He was even
spoken of for the representation of the county; when,
abruptly as he had emerged, he once more retreated
into the seclusion of his laboratory, resisting all the
efforts of his heart-broken wife and friendly wellwishers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

to cause his return to the duties of his rank
and station.</p>

<p>For more than a year he pursued in gloom and
silence his self-appointed task, only taking exercise at
night, and from time to time, as before, joining with
sorcerers and necromancers (as the neighbourhood fully
believed) in unblessed study, if not unholy rites. On
one eventful morn, suspicion being aroused, search
was made for him, when the turret was found to be
vacant, save of broken crucibles, strange scrolls, and
other remnants of the so-called "black art." The
seasons came and went, Massinger Chase grew fair
in early spring and summer prime, the leaves of
many autumns faded and fell, the heir grew from a
rosy infant to a sturdy schoolboy&mdash;a tall stripling.
Then the lady pined and withered, after lingering
sadly in hope of the return of him who never again
crossed the threshold of his ancient hall.</p>

<p>She was laid to rest with the dames of her race.
An authentic statement of the death of Sir Rainauld
reached England from abroad, and his son, Sir Alured,
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it had been discovered after his departure
that large sums had been disbursed, and payments
made to foreign personages. Warrants and vouchers,
legally witnessed, were in the hands of financiers whose
demands could not be legally resisted. Sale had to
be made, with the concurrence of Sir Alured when he
came of age, of portions of the estate, which seriously
curtailed its area and importance. Sir Alured, however,
an easy-going, unambitious youth, had promised his
mother, of whom he was passionately fond, to break
the entail. Contented with the field-sports and homely

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>

pleasures which there was no present danger of his
being forced to relinquish, he cared little for the
future. Notwithstanding the sacrifice of the goodly
acres which (in addition to his portrait in the costume
of a Roumanian heiduck, hanging in King Edward's
corridor) gave Sir Rainauld's descendants something
to remember him by, it had been found necessary to
negotiate another loan upon the security of the estate.
This was looked upon as an unimportant, easily
released encumbrance at the time; but, like all the
tentacles of the dire octopus, Debt, it had a tendency
to draw the debtor closer to that gaping maw, down
which in all ages have gone the old and worn, the
young and fair, the strong and brave, all sorts and
conditions of men.</p>

<p>Sir Alured had no desire to pry into the arcana of
science, nor did he show curiosity about the transmutation
of metals. Indolent, if not self-indulgent, he
was wholly averse to the examination of accounts.
The interest on the mortgage, with occasional loans,
increased the liability notably before his death; so
that when our hero, Sir Roland (an ancestor had fought
at Roncesvalles), came into the estate on attaining his
majority, he was startled at the portentous amount for
which he stood liable to the mortgagee.</p>

<p>Being, however, for his age, a sensible young person,
he set himself to live quietly, to reduce expenses, and
in a general way to pay off his liabilities by degrees.
Just as he had formed these meritorious resolves,
rents commenced to fall. Old tenants, who had been
punctual and regular of payment, began to decline
from their proud position, asking for time, and, what
was still worse, for abatement of rent. And with a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

show of reason. What with the importation of cheap
meat, butter, wheat, and oats&mdash;all manner of farm produce,
indeed, produced in colonies and other countries&mdash;the
English farmer found himself unable to continue
to pay rents calculated on prices which seemed to have
fled for ever. It was hoped that farm commodities
would regain their value, but they receded for the
two years which were to see a recovery. Finally,
after consultations with Messrs. Nourse and Lympett,
it was decided that, at Sir Roland's present scale of
expenditure, there needed to be no compulsory sale
in his time. An heiress would set all right. Sir
Roland must marry money. It was his duty to his
family, his duty to the county, his duty to England.</p>

<p>Then Massinger Court could be restored to its
former splendour, and the estate to its legitimate
position in the county.</p>

<p>Sir Roland did not assent or otherwise to these
propositions. He did not particularly want to marry&mdash;just
yet, at all events. He was too happy and comfortable
as he was. Even with his curtailed revenues,
he found the position of a country gentleman pleasant
and satisfactory. He was not expected to do much,
whereas everybody, old and young, were most anxious
to make themselves useful and agreeable to him. Of
course a man must marry some day.</p>

<p>So much was clearly the duty of the heir of Massinger.
The ancient house must not be suffered to
become extinct.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the succession had always gone
in the direct line. But there was no hurry. He had
not seen any one so far on whom he was passionately
anxious to confer the title of Lady Massinger. So,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

matters might be worse. In this philosophical frame
of mind, he told himself that he was content to remain
a bachelor for the next half-dozen years or so, during
which period his pecuniary affairs might be expected
to improve rather than otherwise.</p>

<p>At eight and twenty a man is young&mdash;very young
indeed, as occasionally reflects the middle-aged <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viveur</i>,
looking regretfully back on the feats and feelings of
his lost youth. Sir Roland was fairly well equipped,
according to the society needs of the day. An Oxford
degree taken creditably guaranteed all reasonable
literary attainment; at any rate, the means and method
of further development. Fond of field-sports, he shot
brilliantly and rode well. Vigorous and active, neither
plain nor handsome, but having an air of distinction&mdash;that
subtle but unmistakeable accompaniment of race&mdash;he
yet presented few points of divergence from the
tens of thousands of youthful Britons capable, in time
of need, of calm heroism and Spartan endurance, but
unaware of any pressing necessity for stepping out of
the beaten track.</p>

<p>Though unostentatious by nature and habit, it was
not to be supposed that the name of Sir Roland
Massinger, of Massinger Court, was unfamiliar to
matrons with marriageable daughters, as well in his
own county, as in the Mayfair gatherings which he
did not disdain during the season.</p>

<p>More than one of his fair partners would not have
objected to bear his name and title embellished, as
his position could not fail to be, by the handsome
settlements which her father's steadfast attention to
trade would enable him to make.</p>

<p>But, so far, all appreciative reception of his ordinary

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

courtesies&mdash;the sudden glance, the winning smile, the
interested attention to his unstudied talk, conservatory
lounges, country-house visits&mdash;all the harmless catalogue
of the boy-god's snares and springes, were
wasted on this careless wayfarer, protected by a lofty
ideal and an untouched heart.</p>

<p>Though he had listened politely to the prudent
counsel of his man of business as to the necessity of
repairing his attenuated fortune by marriage, such an
arrangement had never been seriously contemplated
by him. He felt himself capable of a passionate
attachment to the princess of his dreams, could Fate
but lead him into her presence. Not as yet had he
encountered her. That was beyond doubt. He would
await the voice of the oracle. In the meanwhile he
was far from being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyé</i>. There was a mildly
pleasurable sensation in merely contemplating "the
supreme psychological moment" from afar, and
speculating as to situations not yet arisen. He
awaited in resigned contentment the goddess-moulded
maiden. In the meanwhile he was not minded to
worship at the shrines of the lesser divinities.</p>

<p>Was Fate, unsmiling, ironic, even now listening to
the too-presumptuous mortal?</p>

<p>It would appear so. For, shortly after making
these prudential resolutions, he met at a military ball
the beautiful Hypatia Tollemache, who decided the
question of elective affinity once and for ever. One
look, a brief study of her unrivalled graces, an introduction,
an entrancing interchange of ideas after a
deliriously thrilling dance&mdash;even a second waltz,
perilously near the end of the evening&mdash;and the
solemn chime from the ancient tower, found an echo

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

in his heart, which seemed to ring "forever, ever,
ever, forever."</p>

<p>That there are moments like this in men's lives,
fateful, irrevocable, who may doubt? Sir Roland
did not, at any rate. All the forces of his nature were
aroused, electrically stimulated, magnified in power
and volume. As they separated conventionally, and
he delivered her into the care of her chaperon, the
parting smile with which she favoured him seemed
the invitation of an angelic visitant. He could have
cast himself at her feet, had not the formalism of this
too-artificial age forbidden such abasement.</p>

<p>When he returned to the country house where he
was staying, he examined himself closely as to his
sensations.</p>

<p>How had he, the cool and indifferent Roland
Massinger, come to be so affected by this&mdash;by <em>any</em>
girl? He could almost believe in the philtre of the
ancients. It wasn't the champagne; he had forgotten
all about it, besides being by habit abstemious.
Supper he had hardly touched. It could not even
be a form of indigestion&mdash;here he laughed aloud.
Surely his reason wasn't giving way? He had heard
of abnormal brain-seizures. But he was not the sort
of man. He had never worked hard, though steadily
at college. And, when a man's appetite, sleep, and
general health were faultless, what could have caused
this dire mental disturbance? He went to bed, but
sleep was out of the question. Throwing open the
window, he gazed over the hushed landscape. The
moon, immemorial friend of lovers, came to his aid.
Slowly and majestically she rose, silvering over the
ruined abbey, the ghostly avenue, the far-seen riverpools,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

as with calm, luminous, resistless ascent, she
floated higher and yet higher through the cloud-world.
Gradually his troubled spirit recognized the peaceful
influence. His mind became composed, and betaking
himself to bed, he sank into a slumber from which he
was only aroused by the dressing-bell.</p>

<p>The cheerful converse of a country-house breakfast
succeeding a prolonged shower-bath and a satisfactory
toilette, restored him to a condition more nearly resembling
his usual frame of mind. He was, however,
rallied as to his sudden subjugation, which had not
escaped the keen critics of a ball-room. In defence, he
went so far as to admit that Miss Tollemache was
rather a nice girl, and so on, adding to the customary
insincerities a doubt whether "she wasn't one of the
too-clever division. Scientific, or something in that
line, struck me?"</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Sir Roland," said a lively
girl opposite to him. "You needn't try to back out
of your too-evident admiration of the fair Hypatia&mdash;we
all saw it. Why, you never took your eyes off
her from the moment she came into the room, till you
put her into the carriage. You forgot your dance with
me. You never <em>once</em> asked Jennie Castanette; she
used to be your favourite partner. A sudden attack
of whatsyname at first sight, don't they call it?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know best," he replied; "but Miss
Tollemache is certainly handsome, or, rather, distinguished-looking;
seems clever too, above the average,
though she avoided literary topics."</p>

<p>"Clever!" retorted his fair opponent. "I should
think she is, though I defy you to do more than guess
at it from her talk; she is so unpretending in her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

manner, and has a horror of showing off. Do you
know what she did last year? There wasn't a girl
that came near her in the University examinations."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for her chances of happiness
or that of the man that marries her&mdash;if she is not too
'cultured' to marry at all."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"There are three things that tend to spoil a woman's
character in the estimation of all sensible men," he answered:
"beauty, money, or pre-eminent intellect. The
beauty is flattered into outrageous vanity and frivolity.
The heiress is besieged by suitors and toadies whose
adulation fosters selfishness and arrogance. The third
is perhaps the least evil, as after it is demonstrated
that its possessor cannot lay down the law in private
life, as she is prone to do, she retains a reserve of
resources within herself, and mostly makes a rational
use of them. Depend upon it, the post of honour is a
'middle station.'"</p>

<p>"Indeed! I am delighted to hear it," replied Miss
Branksome. "So we poor mediocrities who have
neither poverty nor riches&mdash;certainly not the last&mdash;and
who don't profess beauty, have a fair chance of happiness?
I was not quite sure of it before. And now,
having unburdened yourself of all this 'philosophy
in a country house,' you will dash off in pursuit of
Hypatia directly you find out what she is going to
do today. What will you give me if I tell you?
'Have you seen my Sylvia pass this way?' and so on."</p>

<p>"Hasn't she gone back to Chesterfield?" he asked.</p>

<p>"So it was erroneously supposed. But Lady Roxburgh
will tell you when she comes down that she
brought off a picnic to the ruins of St. Wereburgh's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

Abbey; that she has been invited from the Wensleydales,
and all the house-party here are going. Unless,
of course, you would prefer to stay behind and have a
peaceful day in the library?"</p>

<p>Sir Roland's face betrayed him. No human
countenance, after such contending emotions as had
almost "rent his heart in twain," could have retained
its immobility.</p>

<p>"There now!" said Miss Branksome, scornfully.
"'What a piece of work is man!' etc. I have been
reading Shakespeare lately&mdash;on wet mornings."</p>

<p>"But are you certain as to the programme?"</p>

<p>"Clara Roxburgh is my authority. The arrangement
was made at an early hour this morning. You
are relied on to drive the drag conveying the ladies
of this household, including my insignificant self&mdash;not
without value, I trust, to <em>some</em> people, however
we poor ordinary mortals may be overshadowed by
'sweet girl graduates.'"</p>

<p>"Then may I venture to ask you, with Lady
Roxburgh's permission, to occupy the box seat?"</p>

<p>"That's very sweet of you; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faute d'autre</i>, of course.
Her ladyship's nerves won't permit of her taking it
herself. And now let me give you a little advice&mdash;'honest
Injun,' I mean&mdash;in all good faith and friendship,
though I know you men don't believe in our
capacity for that. Don't be too devoted. It's a
mistake if you want to be successful; any girl could
tell you. We are mostly annoyed if we're run after.
There's nothing like indifference; it piques us. Then,
if we like a man, we run after <em>him</em>&mdash;in a quiet ladylike
way, of course. Do you follow?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; a thousand thanks. Pray go on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have only one other bit of warning. You're a
lot older than me, and I dare say you think you know
best, as I'm not long out. But you don't. Some day
you'll see it. In the meantime don't give away <em>all</em>
your heart before you make sure of a fair return. She
may lead you on&mdash;unconsciously, of course&mdash;which
means she wouldn't be rude to you and all the rest
of it. But my idea is, she doesn't know what she
wants just now. She's the sort of girl that thinks
she's got a career before her. She won't be satisfied with
the regulation returned affection, matrimony business."</p>

<p>"But surely such a woman has no commonplace
thoughts, no vulgar ideals. She is incapable of such
paltry bargaining for wealth or position."</p>

<p>"You think so? I don't say she's worse than any
other girl who's got such a pull in the way of looks,
brains, family, and all the rest of it. But none of us
like to go cheap, and the love in a cottage business,
or even a man like yourself of good county family,
but <em>not</em> rich, <em>not</em> distinguished&mdash;h'm&mdash;as yet, <em>not</em> a
power socially or politically in the land, is scarcely a
high bid for a first-class property in the marriage
market like Hypatia Tollemache."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Branksome, don't talk like that.
It pains me, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does, but it will do you good in the
long run. It's pretty true, as you'll find out in time.
And now, as I hear Lady Roxburgh coming downstairs,
and I've talked enough nonsense for one morning,
I'll go and get ready for the drag party. You'll know
soon that I have no personal interest in the matter,
though I've liked you always, and don't wish to see
your life spoiled by a sentimental mistake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>And so this very frank young woman departed,
just in time to meet the hostess, who, coming forward,
explained her late arrival at the breakfast table by
saying that she had to send off messages about the
picnic party and an impromptu dance for the evening.
She verified Miss Branksome's information respecting
the drag, and the responsible office of coachman which
Sir Roland expressed himself most willing to accept.
But all the time he was suitably attiring himself; and
even during a visit of inspection to the stables for the
purpose of interviewing the well-matched team, and
having a word or two with the head groom, a feeling
of doubt would obtrude itself as he recalled the well-meant,
unconventional warning of Miss Bessie Branksome.</p>

<p>"I suppose women know a good deal more about
each other's ways than we do," he reflected. "But
an average girl like Miss Branksome, good-hearted
and well-intentioned, as she no doubt is, can no
more enter into the motives of a woman like Miss
Tollemache than a milkmaid could gauge the soul of
a duchess. In any case, I must take my chance, and
I shall have the satisfaction of taking my dismissal
from <em>her</em> lips alone, for no other earthly authority will
detach me from the pursuit. So that's settled."</p>

<p>And when Roland Massinger made use of that
expression in soliloquy or otherwise, a certain line of
action was definitely followed. Neither obstacles nor
dissuasions had the smallest weight with him. In
general, he took pains to work out his plans and to
form his opinion before committing himself to them.
This, however, he admitted, was an exception to his
rule of life. Rule of life? It <em>was</em> his life&mdash;his soul,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

mind, body&mdash;everything. "Whatever stirs this mortal
frame"&mdash;of course. What did Byron say about love?
"'Tis woman's whole existence." Byron didn't know:
he had long since squandered the riches of the heart,
the boundless wealth of the affections. He could <em>write</em>
about love. But the real enthralling, all-absorbing,
reverential passion of a true man's honest love, he did
not know, never could have known, and was incapable
of feeling.</p>

<p>After this burst of blasphemy against the acknowledged
high priest of "Venus Victrix," the great singer
of "love, and love's sharp woe," Sir Roland felt relieved,
if not comforted.</p>

<p>Then came the more mundane business of the day.
The girls' chatter, always more or less sweet in his ears,
like the half-notes of thrushes in spring; the arranging
of pairs, and the small difficulties in mounting to the
high seats of the drag; the monosyllabic utterances
of the swells, civil and military, who helped to compose
the party, at length came to an end.</p>

<p>Finally, when, with pretty, lively, amusing Miss
Branksome on the box seat beside him, he started the
well-matched team, and, rattling down the avenue,
swept through the park gates, and turned into the
road which led to St. Wereburgh's, he felt once more
in comparative harmony with his surroundings.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir Roland, you look more like your old
self&mdash;like the man we used to know. You take my
tip, and back your opinion for all you're worth. If it
comes off, well and good; if it's a boil-over, pay and
look pleasant. If you knew as much about girls as I
do, you'd know there <em>are</em> as good fish in the sea, etc.,
though you men won't believe it. Now, promise me

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>

not to do the Knight of the Woeful Countenance any
more, won't you?"</p>

<p>"As the day is so fine, for a wonder, and the horses
are going well together, not to mention the charming
company of Miss Branksome on the box seat, who
would be perfect if she would drop the didactic
business, I think I may promise."</p>

<p>So, shaking himself together by a strong effort of
will, such as he remembered when acting in private
theatricals, he defied care and anxiety, enacting the
gay worldling with pronounced success. So much so,
that between his prowess as a whip and his cheery
returns to the airy badinage usual on such occasions,
he ran a close second to a cavalry officer on leave
from India for the honourable distinction of "the life
of the party."</p>

<p>Pleasant enough indeed was their progress through
one of the most picturesque counties in England, but
when they stopped within full view of the venerable
ivy-clad ruin, of which a marvellous gateway and a
noble arch still remained perfect, Sir Roland's gaze did
not rest on those time-worn relics of ancient grandeur.</p>

<p>"She's not here yet," said Miss Branksome, with a
smile, after the descent from the drag and the regulation
amount of handshaking, greeting, and "How are
you?" and "How is your dear mother?" had been
got through. "The Wensleydales have farther to
come, and I doubt if their horses are as fast as ours.
Oh yes! now I see them&mdash;just behind that waggon in
the lane, near the bridge. Hypatia is on the box
beside young Buckhurst. <em>He</em> can't drive a bit; that's
a point in your favour, if you can get her to exchange
with me going back. I'll suggest it, anyhow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Roland gave his guide, philosopher, and friend
a look of such gratitude that she began to laugh; but,
composing her countenance to an expression of the
requisite propriety, she advanced to the rival coach,
and so timed her movements that he was enabled to
help the fair Hypatia to the ground&mdash;a slight, but smile-compelling
service, which repaid the giver a hundredfold.</p>

<p>Taking a mean advantage of Buckhurst, who was
compelled for some reason to overlook the unharnessing
of his horses, he thereupon walked away with the
entrancing personage towards the assembled party,
abandoning Miss Branksome, who discreetly preferred
to busy herself in animated conversation with the newcomers.</p>

<p>After this fortunate commencement all went well.
Smiling as the morn, pleased (and what woman is
not?) with the marked attention of a "personage,"
Miss Tollemache confessed the exhilaration proper
to that pleasantest of informal gatherings&mdash;a picnic to
a spot of historic interest in an English county, with
congenial intimates, and perhaps still more interesting
strangers.</p>

<p>Her companion was well up in the provincial
records, and thereby in a position of superiority to
the rest of the company conversationally.</p>

<p>They had pulled up for lunch in the meadow,
deep-swarded and thick with the clovers white and
purple, mingled with the tiny fodder plants which
nestle around a ruin in green England. The party
was full of exclamations.</p>

<p>"What a darling old church!&mdash;thousands of years
old it must be," said one of the Miss Wensleydales.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

"Now, can any one tell me whether it is a Norman
or a Saxon one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Norman, surely!" was the verdict of several
feminine voices, all at once.</p>

<p>"I am not quite certain," said Lady Roxburgh;
"I always intended to look it up. What do you say,
Miss Tollemache? You know more about these
matters than we do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't pretend to any knowledge of architecture.
A grand old ruin like this is such a thing of
beauty that it seems a pity to pick it to pieces. That
south door with its round arches looks rather Saxon.
What does Sir Roland think? It's not far from Massinger,
is it?"</p>

<p>"I used to know it well in my boyhood," replied
that gentleman, who, truth to tell, had been waiting
to be referred to. "Miss Tollemache is right; you
will find its history in the Domesday Book. The
manor was held by the secular canons of St. Wereburgh
till the Conqueror gave it to Hugh Lupus, who
granted it to the Benedictine monks."</p>

<p>"And was it an abbey church?" asked Miss
Branksome, who may or may not have divined Sir
Roland's special knowledge of church history.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied; "all the authorities are
distinct on the point. The manor was held under the
abbots by a family of the same name, so it must
have belonged to the original Saxon stock."</p>

<p>"And why did they not keep it?" asked Lady
Roxburgh. "Really, this is most interesting."</p>

<p>"A lady in the case," answered Sir Roland. "Alice
de Sotowiche conveyed it away by her marriage with
Robert de Maurepas. What the Normans did not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>

get by the sword they seem to have acquired by
matrimony. It did not go out of the family, though,
till the time of Edward the First. These De Maurepases
battled for their manorial rights, too, which
included fishing in the Welland, always providing that
sturgeon went to the overlord."</p>

<p>"I always knew it was a dear old place," said Lady
Roxburgh, "but now it seems doubly interesting. I
must get up this history business for future use, and
Miss Branksome shall give a little lecture about it
next time we have a picnic."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, my dear Lady Roxburgh," said
that young lady, "but I never could learn anything
by heart in my life. I don't mind writing it down,
though, from Sir Roland's notes, so that you can have
it printed for private circulation at breakfast-time on
picnic days."</p>

<p>"I think we might manage a county historical
society," continued her ladyship. "It would be a
grand idea for house-parties&mdash;only now it must be
lunch-time. I see they have been unpacking. We must
verify these quatrefoils, chevrons, and things afterwards."</p>

<p>They lunched under the mouldering walls, picturing
a long-past day when, issuing forth from the courtyard
of the neighbouring castle, had ridden knight and squire
and lady fayre, attended by falconers and woodsmen,
with hawk on wrist and hound in leash.</p>

<p>"What glorious times they must have had of it!"
said Miss Tollemache. "I should like to have lived
then. Life was more direct and sincere than in these
artificial days."</p>

<p>"If we could only have seen the people as they
really were," he replied, "'in their habit as they lived,'

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>

mental or otherwise, it would be such splendid opera
business, would it not? But they must have been
awfully dull between times. Hardly any books, no cigars
till later on; war and the chase their only recreations."</p>

<p>"Noble occupations both," said Miss Tollemache,
with an air of conviction; "they left little room for
the frivolous indolence of these latter days."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," assented her companion. "You had
either to knock people on the head or undergo the
operation yourself. Then, mark the opposite side of
the shield. In that very castle&mdash;while the gay troop
was riding out with pennons flying&mdash;the feudal enemy
or 'misproud' retainer was probably lying in the
dungeon (<em>they had</em> one there, Orme says) after an
imprisonment of years."</p>

<p>The gathering was a pronounced success. The ruin
provided subjects for unlimited conversation as well as
occasions for heroic daring in the matter of climbing.
The lunch was perfect in its way; the ensuing walks
and talks all that could be wished.</p>

<p>And when, after, as one of the young people
declared, the "truly excellent&mdash;really delicious day"
came so near to its close that the horses were brought
up, Miss Branksome playfully suggested that she and
Miss Tollemache should change seats, as she wished
to take a lesson from the opposition charioteer in
driving, and when, after a moment's playful contest,
the fair enslaver was placed on the seat beside him,
Sir Roland's cup of happiness was full.</p>

<p>must have been written by the poet, he felt assured,
with that wondrous instinctive insight into the inmost
soul of him, and all true lovers, which stamps the
heaven-born singer.</p>

<p>Then the drive back to Roxburgh Hall, where they
were to reassemble for the impromptu dance! The
horses, home-returning, pulled just sufficiently to enable
the box passenger to appreciate the strong arm and
steady hand of her companion; and when, after an
hour, the lamps were lit and the star-spangled night
appeared odorous with the scents of early spring, the
girl's low voice and musical laugh seemed the appropriate
song-speech for which the star-clustered night
formed fitting hour and circumstance.</p>

<p>Roland Massinger in that eve of delicious companionship
abandoned himself to hope and fantasy.
His fair companion had been so far acted upon by
her environment, that she had permitted speculative
allusions to the recondite problems of the day; to the
deeper aims of life&mdash;subjects in which she evinced an
interest truly exceptional in a girl of such acknowledged
social distinction; while he, drawn on by the thought
of possible companionship with so rarely-gifted a
being, abandoned his usual practical and chiefly
negative outlook upon the world, acknowledging the
attraction of self-sacrifice and philanthropic crusade.
His mental vision appeared to have received an
illuminating expansion, and as those low, earnest, but
melodious tones made music in his ear, emanating
from the fair lips so closely inclined towards his own,
he felt almost moved to devote his future energies,
means, lands, and life to the amelioration of the race&mdash;to
the grand aims of that altruistic federation of which,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

it must be confessed, that he had been a formal, if not
indifferent, professor. If only he might persuade this
"one sweet spirit to be his minister"! Then, how
cheerfully would he fare forth through whatever lands
or seas she might appoint.</p>

<p>But that fatal <em>if</em>!</p>

<p>Why should <em>he</em> be privileged to appropriate this
glorious creature, redolent of all the loveliness of
earth's primal vigour, and yet informed with the lore
of the ages, heightening her attractions a hundred&mdash;yes,
a thousand-fold? Almost he despaired when
thinking of his superlative presumption.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the safety of the passengers, who
little knew what tremendous issues were oscillating
in the brain of their pilot, he mechanically handled
the reins in his usual skilled and efficient fashion.
Nor, indeed, did the fair comrade, or she would
scarcely have emphasized the conventional remark,
"Oh, Sir Roland, what a delightful drive we have
had! I feel so grateful to you!" as he swung his
horses round, and, with practised accuracy, almost
grazed the steps at the portico of Roxburgh Hall.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Events</span> shaped themselves much after the manner
customary since that earliest recorded compromise
between soul and sense which mortals throughout all
ages have agreed to call Love. Ofttimes such pursuits
and contests have been protracted. After the first
skirmish of temperaments, war has been declared by
Fate, and through wearisome campaigns the rival
armies have ravaged cities, so to speak, and assaulted
neutral powers before the beleaguered citadel surrendered.</p>

<p>At other times, the maiden fortress has been taken
by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>, the assailant's resistless ardour
carrying all before it. More frequently, perhaps, has
the too venturous knight been repulsed with scorn,
and, as in earlier days, been fain to betake himself
to Palestine or other distant region blessed with
continuous warfare, and exceptional facilities for
acquiring fame or getting knocked on the head, as
the case might be.</p>

<p>For the patient and scientific conduct of a siege,
according to the rules of the Court of Love&mdash;and
such there be, if the poets and minstrels of all ages
deserve credence&mdash;Roland Massinger was unfitted by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>

constitution and opinion. His fixed idea was, that
every woman knew her mind perfectly well with
regard to a declared admirer. If favourable, it was
waste of time and emotion to await events. If otherwise,
the sooner a man was made aware of his
dismissal the better. He could then shape his course
in life without distraction or hindrance. In any case
he was freed from the hourly torments under which
the victim writhes, uncertain of his fate. It was the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> which frees the wretch upon the
rack; the knife-thrust which liberates the Indian at
the stake. And he trusted to his manhood to be
equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>When he did "put his fortune to the touch, to
win or lose it all"&mdash;as have done so many gallant
lovers before this veracious history&mdash;he was too deeply
grieved and shocked at the unexpected issue to place
before the fateful maid any of the pleadings or
protests deemed in such cases to be appropriate.
He did not falter out statements inclusive of a
"wrecked life," an "early grave," a career "for ever
closed." Nor did he make the slightest reference
to her having, so to speak, allured him to continue
pursuit&mdash;"led him on," in more familiar terms.</p>

<p>Such commonplaces he disdained, although not
without a passing thought that in the familiar play
of converse, and her occasional touch upon the keynotes
which evoke the deeper sympathies, an impartial
judge might have discovered that perilous liking akin
to love.</p>

<p>No! beyond one earnest appeal to her heart, into
which he implored her to look, lest haply she had
mistaken its promptings&mdash;a plea for time, for cooler

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

consideration&mdash;he had no words with which to plead
his cause, as he stood with sad reproachful gaze,
assuring her that never would she know truer love,
more loyal devotion.</p>

<p>What had she told him? Merely this: "That if
she were to marry&mdash;a step which she had resolved
not to take for some years, if at all&mdash;she confessed
that there was no man whom she had yet known,
with whom she felt more in sympathy, with whom,
taking the ordinary phrase, she would have a greater
prospect of happiness. But she held strong opinions
upon the duties which the individual owed to the
appealing hordes of fellow-creatures perishing for lack
of care, of food, of instruction, by whom the overindulged
so-called upper classes were surrounded.
Such manifest duties were sacred in her eyes, though
possibly incompatible with what was called 'happiness.'
For years&mdash;for ever, it might be&mdash;such considerations
would be paramount with her. They
could be neglected only at the awful price of self-condemnation
in this world and perdition in the next.
She was grieved to the soul to be compelled to refuse
his love. She blamed herself that she should have
permitted an intimacy which had resulted so unhappily
for him&mdash;even for herself. But her resolve was fixed;
nothing could alter it."</p>

<p>This, or the substance of it, fell upon the unwilling
ears of Roland Massinger in unconnected sentences,
in answer to his last despairing appeal. Meanwhile
his idol stood and gazed at him, as might be imagined
some Christian maiden of the days of Diocletian,
when called upon to deny her faith or seal it
with martyrdom. Her eyes were occasionally lifted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>

upward, as if she felt the need of inspiration from
above.</p>

<p>For one moment the heart of her lover stood still.</p>

<p>He placed his hand on his brow as if to quell the
tumult of his thoughts. She moved towards him,
deprecating the intensity of his emotion. An intolerable
sense of her divine purity, her ethereal loveliness,
seemed to pervade his whole being. He felt an
almost irresistible desire to clasp her in his arms in
one desperate caress, ere they parted for ever.
Had he done this, the current of both lives might
have been altered. The coldest maids are merely
mortal.</p>

<p>But he refrained; in his present state of mind it
would have been sacrilege to his ideal goddess, to the
saintly idol of his worship.</p>

<p>Raising her hand reverently to his lips, he bowed
low and departed.</p>

<p>When he thus passed out of her sight&mdash;out of her
life&mdash;Hypatia herself was far from unmoved. Regrets,
questionings, impulses to which she had so far been
a stranger, arose and contended with strange and
unfamiliar power.</p>

<p>Never before had she met with any one in all
respects so attractive to her physically, so sympathetic
mentally; above all things manly, cultured, devoted,
with the instincts of the best age of chivalry. She liked&mdash;yes,
nearly, perhaps quite&mdash;loved him. Family,
position, personal character, all the attributes indispensably
necessary, he possessed.</p>

<p>Not rich, indeed; but for riches she cared little&mdash;despised
them, indeed. Why, then, had she cast away
the admittedly best things of life? For an abstraction!

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>

For toilsome, weary, perhaps ungrateful tasks among
the poor, the disinherited of the earth.</p>

<p>Had not others of whom she had heard, died,
after wasting, so to speak, their lives and opportunities,
with scarcely veiled regrets for the sacrifice?
How many secretly bewailed the deprivation of the
fair earth's light, colour, beauty, consented to in
youth's overstrained sense of obedience to a divine
injunction! Was this wealth of joyous gladness&mdash;the
free, untrammelled spirit in life's springtime,
which bade the bird to carol, the lamb to frisk, the
wildfowl to sport o'er the translucent lake&mdash;but a
snare to lead the undoubting soul to perdition? As
these questioning fancies crossed her mind, in the
lowered tone resulting in reaction from the previous
mood of exaltation, she found her tears flowing fast,
and with an effort, raising her head as if in scorn of
her weakness, hurried to her room.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>A sudden stroke of sorrow, loss, disappointment,
or disaster affects men differently, but the general
consensus is that the blow, like wounds that prove
mortal, is less painful than stunning. Roland
Massinger never doubted but that his wound <em>was</em>
mortal. For days he wondered, in the solitude of his
retreat to which he had, like other stricken deer,
betaken himself, whether or no he was alive. He
returned to the Court. He moved from room to room&mdash;he
absorbed food. He even opened books in the
library and essayed to read, finding himself wholly
unable to extract the meaning of the lettered lines.
He rode and drove at appointed hours, but always
with a strange preoccupied expression. This change

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

of habit and occupation was so evident to his old
housekeeper and the other domestics, that the subject
of their master's obvious state of mind began to be
freely discussed. The groom was of opinion that he
did not know the bay horse that carried him so well
to hounds, from the black mare that was so fast and
free a goer in the dog-cart.</p>

<p>He retired late, sitting in the old-fashioned study
which served as a smoking-room, "till all hours," as
the maids said.</p>

<p>He rose early, unconscionably so, as the gardener
considered who had met him roaming through the
shrubberies before sunrise. A most unusual proceeding,
indefensible "in a young gentleman as could lie
in bed till breakfast-bell rang."</p>

<p>The maids were instinctively of the opinion that
"there was a lady in the case;" but, upon broaching
their ingenuous theory, were so sternly silenced by
Mrs. Lavender, the old housekeeper who had ruled
in Massinger long before Sir Roland's parents had
died, and remembered the last Lady Massinger as "a
saint on earth if ever there was one," that they
hastily deserted it, hoping "as he wouldn't have to be
took to the county hospital." This theory proving
no more acceptable than the other, they were fain to
retire abashed, but clinging with feminine obstinacy to
their first opinion.</p>

<p>Suddenly a change came over the moody squire
who had thus exercised the intelligences of the household.</p>

<p>On a certain morning he ordered the dog-cart, in
which he drove himself to the railway station, noticing
the roadside incidents and mentioning the stud

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>

generally, in a manner so like old times, that the
groom felt convinced that the desired change had
taken place; so that hunting, shooting, and all
business proper to the season would go on again with
perhaps renewed energy.</p>

<p>"When the master jumped down and ordered the
porter to label his trunk 'London,' he was a different
man," said the groom on his return. "He's runnin'
up to town to have a lark, and forgit his woes.
That's what I should do, leastways. He ain't agoin'
to make a break of it along o' Miss Tollemache, or
any other miss just yet."</p>

<p>Though this information was acceptable to the
inmates of a liberally considered household, who one
and all expressed their satisfaction, the situation was
not destined to be lasting. Within a week it was
widely known that Massinger Court was for sale, "just
as it stood," with furniture, farm-stock, library, stud,
everything to be taken at a valuation&mdash;owner about
to leave England.</p>

<p>What surprise, disapproval&mdash;indeed, almost consternation&mdash;such
an announcement is calculated to
create in a quiet county in rural England, those
only who have lived and grown up in such "homes
of ancient peace" can comprehend. A perfect
chorus of wonder, pity, indignation, and disapproval
arose.</p>

<p>The squirearchy lamented the removal of a landmark.
The heir of an historic family, "a steady,
well-conducted young fellow, good shot, straight-goer
in the field&mdash;knew something about farming, too.
Not too deep in debt either? That is, as far as
anybody knew. What the deuce could he mean by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>

cutting the county; severing himself from all his old
friends&mdash;his father's friends, too?"</p>

<p>This was the lament of Sir Giles Weatherly, one
of the oldest baronets in the county. "D&mdash;n it," he
went on to say, "it ought to be prevented by law.
Why, the place was entailed!"</p>

<p>"Entail broken years ago; but that wouldn't mend
matters," his companion, Squire Topthorne, replied&mdash;a
hard-riding, apple-faced old gentleman, credited with
a shrewd appreciation of the value of money. "You
can't force a man to live on a place, though he
mustn't sell it. It wouldn't help the county much to
have the Court shut up, with only the old housekeeper,
a gardener, and a maid, like Haythorpe.
Besides, some decent fellow might buy it&mdash;none of
us could afford to do so just now. <i>I</i> couldn't, I
know."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," returned Sir Giles, "with wheat
at thirty shillings a quarter, and farms thrown back
on your hands, like half a dozen of mine. But why
couldn't Roland have stopped in England; married
and settled down, if it comes to that? There are
plenty of nice girls in Herefordshire; a good all-round
youngster like him, with land at his back,
might marry any one he pleased."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble, from what I hear," said Mr.
Topthorne, with a quiet smile. "Young men have a
way of asking the very girl that won't have them,
while there are dozens that would. Same, the world
over. And the girls are just as bad&mdash;won't take
advice, and end up as old maids, or take to 'slumming'
and Zenana work. I hear it's Hypatia Tollemache
who's responsible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whew-w!" whistled Sir Giles. "She's a fine
girl, and knows her value, I suppose, but she's bitten
by this 'New Woman' craze&mdash;wants to regenerate
society, and the rest of it. In our time girls did what
they were told&mdash;learned house-keeping, and thought
it a fair thing to be the mistress of some good fellow's
household; to rear wholesome boys and girls to keep
up the honour of old England. I have no patience
with these fads."</p>

<p>"Well! it can't be helped. Have you any idea
who is likely to make a bid for the place?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. We're safe to have a manufacturer,
or some infernal colonist&mdash;made his money
by gold-digging or sheep-farming, drops his aitches,
and won't subscribe to the hounds."</p>

<p>"Suppose we do? You're too hard on colonists,
who, after all, are our own countrymen, with the pluck
to go abroad, instead of loafing at home. Often
younger sons, too&mdash;men of as good family as you or I.
We're too conservative here, I often think. They
always spend their money liberally, give employment,
and entertain royally if they do the thing at all."</p>

<p>"I suppose there's something in what you say; but
all the same, I don't like to see a Massinger go out of
the county where his family have lived since the time
of Hugh Lupus. Viscount the Sire de Massinger came
out of Normandy along with Duke William. He was a
marshal commanding a division of archers at Hastings.
'For which service both the Conqueror and Hugh
Lupus rewarded him' (says an old chronicle) 'with vast
possessions, among which was Benham Massinger in
Cheshire; and the said Hamon de Massinger was the
first Baron de Massinger.' There's a pedigree for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>

you! Pity they hadn't kept their lands; but they're
not the only ones, as we know too well."</p>

<p>These and the like colloquies took place during
the period which intervened between the direful
announcement of the sale of the Court and its
actual disposal by an auction sale, at which the late
owner was not present.</p>

<p>It was then made public that the stranger who
bought that "historic mansion, Massinger Court, with
lands and messuages, household furniture, and farm
stock, horses and carriages," was acting as agent only
for Mr. Lexington, the great Australian squatter, who
had made a colossal fortune in New South Wales and
Queensland, numbering his sheep by the half-million
and his cattle by the twenties of thousands. He had,
moreover, agreed to take the furniture, books, pictures&mdash;everything&mdash;at
a valuation, together with the live
stock, farm implements, and&mdash;in fact, the whole place,
exactly as it stood; Sir Roland, the auctioneer said,
having removed his personal belongings previously
to London immediately after offering the Court for
sale. He only returned to bid farewell to the friends
of his youth and the home of his race.</p>

<p>Yes! it <em>was</em> hard&mdash;very hard, he thought, at the
last. There was the garden&mdash;old-fashioned, but rich
in fruit and flower, with box-borders, clipped yew
hedges, alleys of formal shape and pattern; the
south wall where the fruit ripened so early, and to
which his childish eyes had so often been attracted;
the field wherein he had, with the old keeper in
strict attendance, been permitted to blaze at a covey
of partridges&mdash;he remembered now the wild delight
with which he marked his first slain bird; the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

stream in which he had caught his first trout, and
whence many a basket had been filled in later
days; the village church, under the floor of which so
many de Massingers lay buried&mdash;the family pew, too
large for the church, but against the size and shape of
which no innovating incumbent had thought fit to
protest.</p>

<p>How well he remembered his mother's loving hand
as he walked with her to church&mdash;<em>every</em> Sunday, unless
illness or unusual weather forbade! That mother, too,
so gentle, so saintly sweet, so charitable, so beloved,
why should she have died when he was so young?
And his father, the pattern squire, who shot and
hunted, lived much at home, and was respected
throughout the county as a model landlord, who did
his duty to the land which had done so much for the
men of his race? Why should these things be?</p>

<p>He recalled his mother's dear face, which grew pale,
and yet more pale, during her long illness&mdash;her last
words bidding him, to be a good man, to remember
what she taught him, and to comfort his poor father
when she was gone. And how he kneeled by her
bedside, with her wasted hand in his, praying with her
that he might live to carry out her last wishes, and do
his duty fearlessly in the face of all men. Then the
funeral&mdash;the long train of carriages, the burial service,
where so many people wept, and he wished&mdash;how he
wished!&mdash;that he could be buried with her. His father's
set face, almost stern, yet more sorrowful than any
tears. And how he went back to school in his black
clothes, miserable and lonely beyond all words to
describe.</p>

<p>In the holidays, too&mdash;how surprised he had been to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

find that the squire no longer shot, fished, hunted.
He, that was so keen as long as he could remember,
but now sat all day reading in the library, where they
often used to find him asleep. And how, before the
Christmas holidays came round again, he was sent for,
to see his father once more before he died.</p>

<p>The squire spoke not&mdash;he had for days lost the
power of speech&mdash;but he placed his hands upon his
head and murmured an inarticulate blessing. He did
not look pale or wasted like his poor mother, he remembered.
The doctors said there was no particular
ailment; he had simply lost all interest in life. The
old housekeeper summed up the case, which coincided
closely with the public feeling.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," she affirmed, "that if ever a
man in this world died of a broken heart, the squire
did. He was never the same after the mistress died,
God bless her! She's in heaven, if any one is. She
was a saint on earth. And the squire, seeing they'd
never been parted before&mdash;and I never saw two people
more bound up in each other&mdash;well, he couldn't stay
behind."</p>

<p>The new lord of the manor&mdash;for Massinger
held manorial rights and privileges, which had been
tolerably extensive in the days of "merrie England"&mdash;lost
no time in taking possession.</p>

<p>A week had not elapsed before the Australian
gentleman and his family arrived by train at the little
railway station, much like any one else, to the manifest
disappointment of the residents of the vicinity, who
had expected all sorts of foreign appearances and belongings.
Certain large trunks&mdash;<em>not</em> Saratogas&mdash;and
portmanteaux were handed out of the brake-van and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>

transferred to the waggonette, which they filled, while
three ladies with their maid were escorted to the mail
phaeton which had made so many previous journeys
to the station with the visitors and friends of the
Massinger family. A middle-aged, middle-sized, alert
personage, fair-haired, clean-shaved, save for a moustache
tinged with grey, mounted the dog-cart, followed
by a tall young man who looked with an air of scrutiny
at the horses and appointments. He took the reins
from the groom, who got up behind, and with one of
those imperceptible motions with which a practised
whip communicates to well-conditioned horses that
they are at liberty to go, started the eager animal
along the well-kept road which led to the Court.</p>

<p>"Good goer," he remarked, after steadying the
black mare to a medium pace. "If she's sound, she's
a bargain at the money; horses seem tremendously
dear in England."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say so," replied his father. "And
the phaeton pair are good-looking enough for anything:
fair steppers also. I thought the price put on
the horses and cattle high, but the agent told me they
were above the average in quality. I see he was
correct so far."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a comfort to deal with people who are
straight and above-board," said the younger man.
"It saves no end of trouble. I shouldn't wonder if
the home-station&mdash;I mean the house and estate&mdash;followed
suit in being true to description. If so,
we've made a hit."</p>

<p>"Sir Roland wouldn't have a thing wrong
described for the world, sir," here put in the
groom, touching his hat. "No auctioneer would

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

take that liberty with him; not in this county,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it. I thought as much, from seeing
him once," said the elder man.</p>

<p>A short hour saw the black mare tearing up the
neatly raked gravel in front of the façade of the
Court, and by the time the dog-cart had departed
for the stables, the phaeton came up to the door, with
one of the young ladies in the driving seat.</p>

<p>"Well, this <em>is</em> a nice pair of horses!" said the
damsel, who evidently was not unaccustomed to
driving a pair, if not a more imposing team. "Fast,
so well matched and well mannered; it's a pleasure
to drive them. And oh! what a lovely old hall&mdash;and
such darling trees! How fortunate we were to pick
up such a place! It's not too large: there's not much
land, but it's a perfect gem in its way. I suppose we
are to have the pictures of the ancestors, too?"</p>

<p>"We shall have that reflected glory," said the
matron with a smile. "Sir Roland would not sell
them, but hoped we would give them house-room
till he wanted them&mdash;which might not be for years
and years."</p>

<p>"So they will still look down upon us&mdash;or frown,
as the case may be," said the younger girl. "How
savage I should be if I were an ancestor, and new
people came to turn out my descendant!"</p>

<p>"We haven't turned him out. We only buy him
out," said her mother, "which is quite a different thing.
It is the modern way of taking the baron's castle&mdash;without
bloodshed and unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"It is a great shame, all the same, that he
should have to turn out," exclaimed the younger girl,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>

indignantly. "I am sure he is a nice fellow, which
makes it all the worse, because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because every one says so," continued her elder
sister; "as if that was a reason!"</p>

<p>"No! because he has <em>such good horses</em>. When
a man keeps them, in such buckle too, there can't be
much wrong with him."</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the reason that he can't live in a place
like this, I wonder?" queried Miss Lexington in a
musing tone. "A bachelor, too! Men don't seem
to know when they are well off. He ought to try
a dry year on one of our Paroo runs, if he wants a
change. That would take the nonsense out of
him. Our vile sex at the bottom of it, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em> catch a whisper in London, before we left,"
said Miss Violet, cautiously.</p>

<p>"You always do," interrupted her sister. "I hope
you don't talk to Pinson confidentially. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Only that a girl that every one seemed to know
about wouldn't have him, and that he nearly went
out of his mind about it: wouldn't hear of living in
England afterwards."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he'll know better some day&mdash;won't
he, mother? He must be a romantic person to go
mooning about, wanting to die or emigrate, for a trifle
like that."</p>

<p>"I sometimes wonder if you girls of the present
day have hearts, from the way you talk," mused the
matron. "However, I suppose they're deeper down
than ours used to be. But I don't like my girls to
sneer at true love. It's a sacred and holy thing,
without which we women would have a sad time in
this world. But, in our own country, men have done

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>

rash things in the agony of disappointment. You
have heard of young Anstruther?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, long ago. He went home and shot
himself because of a silly girl. I suppose he's sorry
for it now."</p>

<p>"Hearts are much the same, in all countries and
ages, depend upon it, my dears; they make people do
strange things. But let us hope that there will be no
unruly promptings in this family."</p>

<p>"Quite so, mother&mdash;same here; but I suppose,
as Longfellow tells us, 'as long as the heart has
woes,' all sorts of droll things will happen. And now
suppose we go and look at the stables before afternoon
tea; I want to see the hunters and polo ponies.
The garden we can see tomorrow morning."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>When Sir Roland, having made final arrangements,
concluded to run down to Massinger for farewell
purposes, he declined courteously Mr. Lexington's
invitation to stay with him, and took up his abode
at the Massinger Arms, in the village, where he considered
he would be quiet and more independent.
He felt himself obliged to say farewell to the people
he had known all his life, small and great. But
he never had less inclination for conversation and
the ordinary society business. A week at the outside
would suffice for such leave-taking as he considered
obligatory.</p>

<p>As to the emigration matter which had so disturbed
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monde</i>, another factor of controlling power entered
into the calculation. A re-valuation of his property
made it apparent that when every liability came to
be paid off, the available residue would be much

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>

less than he or his men of business reckoned on.
Not more, indeed, than the ridiculously small sum of
thirty or forty thousand pounds. He was not going
to live on the Continent, or any cheap foreign place,
on this. Nor to angle for an heiress. So, having
been informed that he could live like a millionaire
in the colonies, and probably make a fortune out of
a grazing estate which half the money would purchase,
there was nothing to keep him in England. Such
considerations, reinforced by the haunting memories
of a "lost Lenore" in the guise of Hypatia, drove
him forward on his course <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outre mer</i> with such
feverish force that he could scarcely bear to await
the day of embarkation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> could not well refuse an invitation to dinner from
his successor, who called upon him, in form, the day
after his arrival, and again begged him to make the
old hall his home until he left England.</p>

<p>This request he begged to decline, much to Mr.
Lexington's disappointment, though he agreed to
dine.</p>

<p>"My people were looking forward to having your
advice upon all sorts of matters, which, of course, you
would know about better than any one else. We are
not going to make any great changes that I know of,"
said Mr. Lexington. "Everything on the estate is in
excellent order; your overseer&mdash;I mean bailiff&mdash;seems
sensible and experienced. I shall give him his own
way chiefly. He knows the place and the people,
which of course I don't. My children, being Australians,
are fond of horses; they are so much pleased
with your lot, that you may be sure of their being
well treated&mdash;and pensioned, when their time comes.
I never sold an old favourite in my life, and am not
going to begin in England, though you can't turn out
a horse here all the year round as you can in
Australia. And now I'll say good afternoon. Sorry

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

you can't stay with us. We shall see you at dinner&mdash;half-past
seven; but come any time."</p>

<p>Upon which Mr. Lexington departed, leaving a
pleasant impression with the former owner.</p>

<p>"What mistaken prejudices English people have,
for the most part!" he thought. "Sir Giles Weatherly,
I heard, was raving at my want of loyalty to the
landed interest because I had left an opening for
some 'rough colonist' to break into our sacred
county enclosure. This man is a thorough gentleman,
liberal and right-feeling; besides, with pots of
money too, he will be able to do far more for the
neighbourhood than would ever have been in my
power. I shouldn't be surprised if the county considers
him an improvement upon an impoverished
family like ours before many months are past."</p>

<p>With a half-sigh, involuntary, but not without
a distinct feeling of regret, as he thought how soon
his place would be filled up, and how different a
position would have been his had one woman's
answer been otherwise, he addressed himself once
more to the momentous question of emigration. He
had purchased a quantity of colonial literature, and
had made some headway through the handbooks
thoughtfully provided for the roving Englishman of
the period. The difficulty lay in deciding between
the different offshoots of Britain. All apparently
possessed limitless areas of fertile land and rich
pasturage, in addition to goldfields, coal-mines, opal
and diamond deposits, silver and copper mines, the
whole vast territory reposing in safety under the
world-wide ægis of the British flag.</p>

<p>Before he had found anything like a solution of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>

this pressing problem, the church clock suggested
dressing. So, attiring himself suitably, he made his
way to the Court. He rang the hall-door bell somewhat
impatiently, having only partially got over the
feeling of strangeness at being invited to dinner at
his own house, so to speak, and being shown into the
drawing-room by his own butler. This official's gravity
relaxed suddenly, after a vain struggle, and ended in
a gasping "Oh, Sir Roland!" as he announced him
in due form.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, where nothing had been
added or altered, he found three ladies, the son of
the house, and his host. "Mrs. Lexington, Miss
Lexington, and my daughter Violet, with my son
Frank," comprehended the introductions.</p>

<p>All were in evening attire, the ladies very quietly
but becomingly dressed. The dinner was much as
usual; his own wines, glass, and table decorations
were in the same order as before. Could he have
given a dinner-party unawares? His position at the
right hand of Mrs. Lexington seemed hardly to decide
the question.</p>

<p>No reference was made by any of the company,
which included the rector of the parish (a few minutes
late), to his reasons for expatriating himself, though
expressions of regret occurred that he should be
leaving the country.</p>

<p>"My daughters are lost in astonishment that you
should voluntarily quit such a paradise, as it appears
to us sunburnt Australians," said the lady of the
house.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have got <em>me</em> to leave it without a
fight," said Miss Lexington; "but I suppose men get

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

tired of comfort in this dear old country, where everything
goes on by itself apparently, and even the
servants seem 'laid on' like the gas and water. They
must want danger and discomfort as a change."</p>

<p>"There would not appear to have been much in
the country from which you came," replied Sir Roland,
declining the personal question.</p>

<p>"We have had our share," said Mr. Lexington.
"Fortunately one is seldom the worse for it; perhaps
the more fitted to enjoy life's luxuries, when they come
in their turn. Tell Sir Roland something, Frank,
about that dry season when you were travelling with
the 'Diamond D' cattle."</p>

<p>"Rather early in the evening for Queensland stories,
isn't it?" replied the younger man thus invoked, who
did not, except in a deeper tint of bronze, present any
point of departure from the home-grown product. "Tell
him one or two after dinner. I'd rather have his
advice about the country sport, if he'll be good enough
to enlighten me."</p>

<p>"A better guide than my old friend the rector
here the country doesn't hold," said the ex-squire.
"He knows to a day when 'cock' may be expected,
and though he doesn't hunt now, he used to be in
the first flight; as for fishing, he's Izaak Walton's
sworn disciple. I leave you in good hands. All the
same, I'm ready to be of use in any way."</p>

<p>"The weather feels warm now, even to us. We
hardly expected such a day," remarked Mrs. Lexington;
"and as we have none of us been home before,
we don't quite know what to make of it."</p>

<p>"If it's a trifle warm and close, it never lasts more
than a few days, they tell me," said the eldest daughter;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>

"and the nights are always cool. That's one comfort.
I always feel like putting a new line in my prayers of
thankfulness for there being hardly any flies and no
mosquitoes. And such lovely fresh mornings to wake
up in! Such trees, such grass! No wonder the
hymns speak of 'a happy English child!'"</p>

<p>"All the same, Australia is not a bad country,"
said Mrs. Lexington, "though we did have seventeen
days once at the Macquarie River when it was a
hundred in the shade every day and ninety every
night. On the other hand, the Riverina winter was
superb&mdash;such cloudless days and merely bracing
mornings and evenings. I dare say we shall miss
<em>them</em> here in 'chill October.' Sir Roland will give us
his impressions when he returns, perhaps," she continued.
"It is hard to find a climate which is pleasant
all the year round. A cool summer is enjoyed at the
expense of a cold winter. And we have extremes
even in Australia. I saw in the paper lately some
account of pedestrians being thirty hours in snow, and
much exhausted when they reached their destination
after being out all night."</p>

<p>"I should hardly have thought that possible," said
the guest, genuinely astonished.</p>

<p>"English people hear more of the heat of our
climate than the cold," said his host, good-humouredly;
"but the mails are carried on snow-shoes in the winter
season of a town I know, and I have seen the children
going to school in them too."</p>

<p>"Oh, come! dad will soon begin to tell stories
about snakes," said Miss Violet, "if we don't turn the
conversation. Do you have much lawn tennis in the
neighbourhood, Sir Roland?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good deal," he replied, "as the rector will tell
you. His daughters are great performers, and at the
last tournament with West Essex Miss Charlton was
the champion."</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful! We all play except dad and
mother, so we shall be able to keep up our form."</p>

<p>"Then it's not too hot in the Australian summer
for exercise?"</p>

<p>"It's never too hot for cricket, or dancing, or tennis
in our country. We couldn't do without them, so the
weather must take its chance. After all, a little heat,
more or less, doesn't seem to matter."</p>

<p>"Apparently not," said Sir Roland, noting the girl's
well-developed figure, regular features, and animated
expression.</p>

<p>In truth, they were both handsome girls, though
their complexions showed a clear but healthy pallor,
as distinguished from the rose-bloom of their British
sisters. If Sir Roland had not been dead to all
sympathetic consideration of the great world of woman,
it would have occurred to him that a man might "go
farther and fare worse" than by choosing either of
these frank, unspoiled maidens, rich in the possession
of the charm of youth and the crowning glory of the
sex&mdash;the tender, faithful heart of a true woman.</p>

<p>But to his dulled and disturbed senses, not as yet
recovered from the merciless blow dealt him by fate,
no such appreciation of their youthful graces was
possible.</p>

<p>He was courteous to the utmost point of politeness,
scrupulously attentive to their queries about this, to
them, unfamiliar land of their forefathers; careful also
to requite the consideration with which he felt they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>

had regarded him. But they might have been any
one's maiden aunts, or indeed grandmothers, for all
the personal interest which he felt in them. Indeed,
when Mrs. Lexington caught her eldest daughter's
eye and proceeded to the drawing-room, he was
distinctly conscious of a feeling of relief.</p>

<p>Then, as he drew up his chair at the suggestion
of his host, he began to show increased interest, as
the question of a desirable colony to betake himself
to was mooted.</p>

<p>"You are not in the same position as many young
men whom Frank and I have met. You are accustomed
to a country life, and have a practical knowledge
of farming. Your cattle and sheep (we went
through them this morning) do the management
credit, and the bailiff tells me that you directed it in
a general way. The crops and the grass lands are
A 1. So you won't have so much to learn when you've
thought out the climate in Australia. May I consider
that you prefer agriculture to a pastoral life?"</p>

<p>"I must say that I do, though I don't limit myself
to any particular pursuit or investment. I should feel
grateful for your advice in the matter."</p>

<p>"We are all New South Wales people, born there
indeed, and probably prejudiced in its favour. It is
the mother colony of Australia, and until lately the
largest, so that there was always plenty of scope. We
have never, like most of the larger pastoralists, had
much to do with farming, preferring to buy our hay,
corn, flour, and such trifles from the small settlers."</p>

<p>"The squatters, as I suppose they are called,"
interposed Massinger, who was beginning to be proud
of his colonial knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," corrected the colonist. "The
smaller holders are called farmers, or 'free-selectors,'
having by a late Act of Parliament acquired the right
of free choice over the Crown lands leased in vast
acres to the squatters. They follow farming exclusively
as an occupation, and are chiefly tenants, or men of
small capital. The squatter, on the other hand, is
the Australian country gentleman&mdash;the landlord, where
he is a free holder. It is therefore the more fashionable
pursuit, so to speak, and as such, has proved
attractive to men like yourself, who commence colonial
life with a fair amount of capital. Perhaps Frank will
give you his views."</p>

<p>"I never could stand farming at any price," said
the younger colonist. "I hardly know a turnip from
a potato. My fancy has always been for the big
outside stations. There's something to stir a man's
blood in managing a property fifty miles square,
with plain, forest, and river to match. Then twenty
thousand head of cattle, or a hundred thousand sheep
to organize a commissariat for, and an army of men
to command! There's no time to potter about
ploughing and harrowing, haymaking or reaping, in
country like that. You might as well dig your own
garden."</p>

<p>"But surely they are necessary occupations?"
queried the intending colonist.</p>

<p>"Not to men with a million of acres or so in hand.
They can't worry over details. We buy everything we
want in that way, and have it brought to our doors,
more cheaply than we could grow it. Our work in
life, so far, is to produce cheap beef, mutton, and
wool, to feed your people and for them to manufacture.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>

That, I take it, is our present business, and anything
that interferes with it is a loss to the empire."</p>

<p>"That seems a short list of products for a great
country like yours. Couldn't you supply anything
more from the land?"</p>

<p>"All in good time," said the young man, sipping
his claret. "By-and-by, when labour becomes more
plentiful and the population denser, we shall send
you butter and bacon, cheese, honey, fruit, flour, sugar,
wine, and oil&mdash;even rabbits, confound them!&mdash;by the
million. These products, when we have time, and
have overtaken the local demand, we can export by
the shipload. A hundred thousand frozen lambs&mdash;that
kind of thing&mdash;in one steamer."</p>

<p>"But you have said nothing about horses. Surely
I have heard that your country is very suitable for
rearing them?" asked their guest.</p>

<p>"Suitable!" ejaculated the young Australian, with
more animation than he had previously expressed.
"I should think so. Yet up to this day, though a
fascinating pursuit, horses haven't paid so well as sheep
and cattle. But our time is coming. I have always
maintained that we could breed cavalry and artillery
horses for all Europe&mdash;more cheaply, too, than any
other country in the world; horses possessing extraordinary
courage, stoutness, speed, and constitution.
From the way in which they are reared on the natural
grasses in the open air, they have the best feet and
legs in the world. The Indian buyers find them more
suitable for cavalry and artillery than Arabs or their
own stud-breds, but as yet they only take a tenth
part of what we could rear if the markets were more
steady and assured. It will be proved some day that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>

the English horse gains in stoutness in Australia
after a generation, and I look forward even to our
sending you back pure Australian thoroughbreds,
equal in speed to their imported grandsires, but
sounder, stronger in constitution, and with more bone."</p>

<p>As the descendant of Kentish squires spoke with
heightened feeling upon what was evidently a favourite
theme, Massinger could not help admitting that the
speaker himself was no bad exemplar of the favourable
conditions of a free, adventurous, roving life upon the
Anglo-Saxon type. Frank Lexington was, indeed, as
fine a man as you could make physically&mdash;a description
once applied to him by an enthusiastic admirer
at an up-country race meeting. Standing somewhat
over six feet in height, he was admirably proportioned,
and not less for strength than activity. His features
were regular, approaching the Greek ideal in outline,
while his steady eye and square jaw denoted the
courage and decision which, young as he seemed, had
been tested full many a time and oft. His hands,
though bronzed and sinewy with occasional experiences
of real hard work, were delicately formed, while his
filbert nails, perhaps as true a test as any other of
gentle blood and nurture, had evidently never lacked
careful tendance.</p>

<p>Fairly well read, and soundly if not academically
educated, he was but one of a class of the present
generation of Australians who do no discredit to the
imperial race from which they spring.</p>

<p>Before these reflections had come to a conclusion,
however, Mr. Lexington rose, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now that Frank has got to the horses of his
native country, we had better adjourn the debate, if

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>

you won't take another glass of port, or his mother
and sisters will be scolding us for staying too long
over our wine."</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival in the drawing-room the
opposition found a speaker.</p>

<p>"We thought you were never coming, daddy dear,"
said Miss Violet. "What in the world do men find to
talk about when <em>we're</em> not there? I suppose, though,
that you were giving Sir Roland a lecture on colonial
experience, and Frank had fallen foul of the shooting
and fishing topics, or, worst of all, the great horse
question! Ah! I see you look guilty, so I won't say
any more about it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's very natural, my dear," said Mrs.
Lexington. "Of course Sir Roland knows as little of
colonial life as your father does about English farming.
Either experience would be valuable, you know."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," quoth the merry damsel,
who appeared to be of independent mind. "I've rarely
known dad take any one's opinion but his own; and
as to advising new&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;new arrivals in
Australia, you remember what Jack Charteris said
when somebody asked him to do so?"</p>

<p>"Something saucy, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Oh no; it was only to this effect&mdash;that if the
young fellow had any common sense, he would soon
find out everything for himself; and if he hadn't,
nothing that you could say would do him any good."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you will give Sir Roland a
strange idea of Australian young ladies' manners. For
a change, Marion might try this lovely piano. It's
almost new; too good for a bachelor's establishment."</p>

<p>Massinger winced a little, but did not explain that,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>

as the adored personage had once been inveigled into
joining an afternoon tea at the Court on the way back
from a tennis match, of which he had received timely
notice, he had ordered a new grand piano to be sent
down from London, so that it might be ready for her
divinely fair fingers to essay.</p>

<p>"The other one," he replied, carelessly, "was rather
old&mdash;had, indeed, been sent up to a morning-room;
just did for practising on when ladies were in the
house."</p>

<p>"I should think it did," said Miss Lexington,
indignantly. "Why, it's better now than half the
people have in their drawing-rooms. I'm afraid you
won't make much of a fortune in Australia if you're
so extravagant. Three hundred and fifty pounds'
worth of pianos in a house with a family of <em>one</em>!"</p>

<p>"I'm like the man in your sister's story, Miss
Lexington," said he, smiling at the girl's earnestness.
"Advice will be thrown away upon me. But perhaps
I may improve after a few months."</p>

<p>"Months!" said the girl; and a sudden look almost
of compassion changed the lustre of her dark grey
eyes. "How little you know of the <em>years</em> and years
before you!&mdash;the changes and chances, the bad
seasons, the dull life; and then perhaps nothing at
the end&mdash;absolutely nothing! And to come away
from this!" And she looked round the noble room,
which, if not magnificently furnished, was yet replete
with modern comfort, and had, in the priceless pieces
of carved oaken furniture, the air of ancient and long-descended
possession. "How <em>could</em> you?"</p>

<p>He turned and faced her with an air of smiling
but irrevocable decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"My resolve was not taken without consideration,
I assure you; and I have yet to learn that an Englishman
is likely to find himself at fault among his
countrymen in any of Britain's colonies. But I am
anxious to hear my ecstatic instrument for the last
time."</p>

<p>Marion Lexington, as are many Australian girls,
had been extremely well taught&mdash;received, indeed, the
instruction of an artist of European reputation. Her
ear was faultless, her taste accurate. She therefore,
after a prelude of Bach's, broke into one of Schubert's
wild, half-mournful "Momens Musicals," which she
played with such feeling and power as rather to
surprise her hearer, who, a fair judge, and something
of an amateur, was no mean critic. She did not sing,
she explained, but after she had concluded with a
Scherzo, Miss Violet was prevailed upon to sing a
couple of songs, which showed, by the management
of a pure soprano, that she had received the tuition
which had fitly developed its high quality.</p>

<p>Massinger could hardly refrain from expressing a
faint degree of surprise, as he wondered how systematic
training was possible in the primitive surroundings of
a pastoral life.</p>

<p>"An English judge in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cause célèbre</i> once described
the squatter's occupation as a 'rude wandering life,'"
said Mr. Lexington, smiling; "but for many years my
wife and the girls lived in Sydney during the summer,
and only went to our principal station, which is near
a large inland town in the interior, for the winter&mdash;a
season lovely beyond description. So my daughters
enjoyed educational facilities not inferior, perhaps, to
those of country towns in England."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like most Englishmen, I must confess to having
formed incorrect ideas about our colonial possessions.
However, I shall have ample time to amend them, if
Miss Violet's prophecy comes true."</p>

<p>"Never mind her, Sir Roland," said her mother,
stroking the girl's fair hair. "She is a naughty girl,
and always says the first thing that comes into her
head. It is just as likely that we shall see you back
again with a colossal fortune in five years. Mr.
Hazelwood that bought Burrawombie did, you know!
You remember him, don't you, Frank? And if a bank-failure
epidemic sets in, as was once threatened, we
may just then be wanting to sell out and go back to
Australia to retrench."</p>

<p>"I give everybody fair warning," said Miss Violet,
starting up from her mother's side, "that <em>I</em> am going
to settle permanently in England before that takes
place. I couldn't endure returning under those circumstances.
As a girl with a 'record,' as that American
one said who had danced with the Prince, I might be
induced to face George Street and Katoomba again;
but not otherwise!"</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Farewells had been said, old friends and old
haunts revisited. The whole able-bodied population
of Massinger Court, tower and town, had apparently
turned out to do honour to their late landlord and
employer, and when Sir Roland deposited himself in
an engaged carriage by insistence of the veteran stationmaster,
and was, as the phrase runs, "left alone with
his thoughts," an involuntary lowering of his animal
spirits occurred.</p>

<p>He had, as his friends and acquaintances fully

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>

believed, cut loose from all old associations&mdash;"turned
himself out of house and home," as some familiarly
expressed it&mdash;quitted for ever the old hall which had
been in the possession of his family in unbroken line
since the Conquest, and committed his fortunes to
the conditions of a rude, quasi-barbarous country.</p>

<p>And for what? For a most insufficient reason, as
all the world thought.</p>

<p>What was the abnormal incident which had brought
about this dislocation of his whole life, which had made
havoc of all previous aims and prospects? Merely the
too highly wrought imagination of a girl&mdash;of a silly
girl, people would doubtless say.</p>

<p>Well, they could hardly so describe Hypatia
Tollemache, who had proved the possession of one of
the finest intellects of the day, and had taken almost
unprecedented academical honours.</p>

<p>At any rate, she might come under the biting
regal deliverance, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours femme varie, bien fol qui
s'y fie</i>. But <em>was</em> she changeable? He could not say
so with any show of sincerity.</p>

<p>She had been true&mdash;too true&mdash;to her ideal. Would
that she had not been so steadfast to a vain imagining,
an emotional craze!</p>

<p>A dream, a vision that she was destined by example,
precept, self-sacrifice, what not, to elevate her sex in
particular, the toiling masses in general, the helpless
poor, the forgotten captives, despairing, tortured, chained
to the oar of the blood-stained galley, "Civilization,"
falsely so called! Confessedly a lofty ideal. Yet how
needless a devotion of her glorious beauty, her precious,
all too fleeting youth, her divine intellect, to the thankless
task of helping those to whom Providence had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>

denied the power of helping themselves; of expending
these God-given treasures upon feeble or deformed
natures, who, when all had been lavished, were less
grateful for the abundant bounty than envious of the
higher life, grudgingly displeased that more had not
been dispensed.</p>

<p>However, the fiat had gone forth. She must be
the arbiter of her own fate. He disdained to beg
for a final reconsideration of his suit. Only, he could
not have borne to remain and continue the daily round
of country life, the rides and drives, the tennis and
afternoon teas, the fishing, the shooting, when he
knew the exact number of pheasants in each spinney,
the woodcocks expected in every copse. The hunting
was nearly as bad, except for the advantages of a turn
more danger.</p>

<p>No; a new land, a new world, for him! Complete
change and wild adventure; no ordinary derangement
of conditions would medicine the mind diseased which
was ever abiding with the form of Roland Massinger.
His passage was already secured in one of the staunch
seaboats which justify the maritime pride of the
Briton; he was pledged to sail for the uttermost
inhabited lands of the South in less than a week's
time. The matter settled, he continued to devote
himself assiduously to acquiring information, and felt
partially at ease as to his future.</p>

<p>The most desirable colony still seemed to be a
kind of <i>ignis fatuus</i>.</p>

<p>He read blue-books, compilations, extracts from
letters of correspondents&mdash;all and everything which
purported to direct in the right path the undecided
emigrant&mdash;with the general result of confusing his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

mind, and delaying any advance to a purpose which
he might have gained. Finally, he fixed, half by
chance, upon Britain's farthest southern possession&mdash;New
Zealand&mdash;the Britain of the South, as it had
been somewhat pretentiously styled by a Company,
more or less historical, which had essayed to monopolize
its fertile lands and "civilize" its tameless
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the frame of mind in which Massinger found
himself, an account of the war of 1845, in which a
Maori patriot threw down the gage of battle to the
"might, majesty, and dominion" of England, obstinately
resisting her overwhelming power and disciplined
troops, aroused his interest, and came to exercise a
species of fascination over him.</p>

<p>The valour of the Maori people, their chivalry,
their eloquence, their dignity, their delight in war
and skill in fortification, impressed him deeply. The
Australian colonies had but an uninteresting aboriginal
population, small in number and scarcely raised above
the lowest races of mankind. They held few attributes
valuable to a student in ethnology&mdash;and this was one
of his strongest predilections&mdash;whereas among the
warrior tribes of New Zealand there would be endless
types available for a philosophical observer.</p>

<p>The nature of the country also appealed to his
British habitudes. Fertile lands, running rivers, snow-clad
mountains, picturesque scenery, all these chimed
in with his earliest predilections, and finally decided
his resolution to adopt New Zealand as his abiding-place&mdash;that
wonderland of the Pacific; that region of
everlasting snow, of glaciers, lakes, hot springs, and
fathomless sounds, excelling in grandeur the Norwegian

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>

fiords; of terraces, pink and white&mdash;nature's delicatest
lace fretwork above fairy lakelets of vivid blue!</p>

<p>It was enough. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Facta est alea!</i> Henceforth with
the land of Maui the fortunes of Roland Massinger
are inextricably mingled.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Modern arrangements for changing one's hemisphere
are much the same in the case of the emigrant
Briton whom kind fortune has included in "the classes."
For him the sea-change is made delightfully easy.
Luxuriously appointed steamers await his choice, distances
are apparently shortened. Time is certainly
economised. Agreeable society, if not guaranteed,
is generally provided. Tradesmen contend for the
privilege of loading the traveller with a superfluous,
chiefly unsuitable, outfit. Letters of introduction are
proffered, often to dwellers in distant colonies, mistaken
for adjacent counties.</p>

<p>Advice is volunteered by friends or acquaintances
of every imaginable shade of experience, diverse as
to conditions and contradictory in tendency.</p>

<p>Firearms of the period, from duck-guns to pocket-pistols,
are suggested or presented; while the regretful
tone of farewell irresistibly impresses the mind of the
wanderer that, unless a miracle is performed in his
favour, he will never revisit the home of his fathers.</p>

<p>From many of these drawbacks to departure our
hero freed himself by resolutely declining to discuss
the subject in any shape. He admitted the fact, gave
no reasons, and assented to many of the opinions as
to the patent disadvantage of living out of England.
He resisted the outfitter successfully, having been
warned by Frank Lexington against taking anything

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

more than he would have required for a visit to an
English country house.</p>

<p>"Take <em>all</em> you would take there, but nothing more."</p>

<p>"What! dress clothes, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Of course! People dress much as they do here in
all the colonies. If you're asked to dinner here, you
wouldn't go in a shooting-coat; neither do they. In
the country, in the bush, of course minor allowances
are made."</p>

<p>"But guns and pistols surely?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you wish to practise at the sea-birds
on the way out, which few of the captains permit
nowadays. You will find that you can buy every kind
of firearm there at half the price you would pay here&mdash;equally
good, mostly unused, the property of young
men who have been induced to load themselves with
unnecessary accommodation for man and beast.
Saddlery, harness, agricultural implements, are all
included in my list of unnecessaries."</p>

<p>"Then, what <em>am</em> I to take?" inquired Massinger,
appalled at this stern dismissal of the accepted emigration
formula.</p>

<p>"The clothes on your back, a couple of spare suits,
a few books for the voyage, and what other articles
may be contained in a Gladstone bag and two trunks;
all else is vanity, and most assured vexation of
spirit."</p>

<p>"And how about money?"</p>

<p>"There you touch the great essential&mdash;leaving it
to the last, as we often do. Take, say, fifty sovereigns
for the voyage&mdash;thirty would be ample, but it is as
well to leave a margin. And of course half or a
quarter of your available capital in the shape of a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>

bank draft. You will find that it is worth much
more, so to speak, than here."</p>

<p>"I mean to invest the greater part of it in land"&mdash;with
decision.</p>

<p>"All right; as to that, I won't offer an opinion. I
know next to nothing about New Zealand. Look out
when you <em>do</em> buy. Some fellow told me there was
trouble with the native titles; and lawsuits about
land are no joke, as we have reason to know."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear fellow," said our hero; "I
shall always be grateful for your valuable hints. I
hate the word 'advice.'" And as this happened in
London, the two young men had dined together at
the Reform Club, of which Massinger was a member,
and gone to the theatre afterwards, wisely reflecting
that such an opportunity might not again occur for a
considerable period.</p>

<p>Before the day of departure he received, among
others, a letter of feminine form and superscription,
which read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir Roland</span>,</p>

<p>"As you are betaking yourself to the ends of the earth, after the
unreasoning fashion which men affect, you won't be alarmed at my
affectionate mode of address. I really <em>have</em> a strong friendly
interest in your welfare, though the nature of such a feeling on a
girl's part is generally suspected. Perhaps, as you cannot get over
your temporary grief about Hypatia, you are right to do something
desperate. She will respect you all the more for this piece of
foolishness. (Excuse me.) Women mostly do, if they have hearts (some
haven't, of course), but they themselves generally

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

believe they are not worth any serious sacrifice. A
really 'nice' woman is about the best prize going, if
a man can get her; only the mistake he makes is
in not knowing that there are lots of other women
in the world&mdash;'fish in the sea,' etc.&mdash;who are certain
to appreciate him if they get a chance, so nearly as
good, or so alike in essentials, that he would hardly
find any difference after a year or two.</p>

<p>"So, for the present, you are right to go away and found more Englands,
and chop down trees, and fight with wild beasts&mdash;are there any in New
Zealand, or only natives? Doing all this with a view of knocking all
the nonsense, as we girls say, out of your head. Time will probably
cure you, as it has done many another man. With us women&mdash;foolish
creatures!&mdash;more time is generally needed; why, I'm sure I don't know.
Perhaps because we can't smoke or drink, in our dark hours, like you
men when you are thrown over.</p>

<p>"I wish you luck, anyhow. Some day when you come back&mdash;for I refuse to
believe you will never see Massinger Court again&mdash;you will tell me if I
am a true prophet. My tip is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Within the next five years Hypatia will have got tired of slumming,
lecturing, teaching, and generally sacrificing herself for the heathen,
and will hear reason; or you will find a <em>replica</em> of her in Australia
or Kamtschatka, or wherever your wandering steps may lead, who will do
nearly or quite as well to ornament your humble home.</p>

<p>"And now, after this infliction of genuine friendly counsel, I will
conclude with a little personal item which may explain my protestations
of merely platonic

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>

interest in your concerns. I have been engaged to Harry Merivale for
nearly three years. It was a dead secret, as he was too poor to marry.
In those days you once did him a good turn, he told me. <em>Now</em> he has
got his step, and his old aunt has come round, so we are to be <em>married
next month</em>.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will give me joy, and believe me ever,</p>

<p class="center">"Your sincere friend and elder sister,<br /></p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Bessie Branksome."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><br />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the exception of certain yachting trips, Mr.
Roland Massinger, as he now called himself, having
decided to drop the title for the present, had no
experience of ocean voyaging. A well-found yacht,
presided over by an owner of royal hospitality and
fastidious friendships, with carefully selected companions,
and the pick of the mercantile marine for a
crew, leaves little to be desired. Fêted at every port,
and free to stay, or glide onwards as the sea-bird o'er
the foam&mdash;such a cruise affords, perhaps, the ideal
holiday.</p>

<p>But this was a far different experience. A shipload
of perfect strangers, many of them not indifferent, like
himself, to changing scene and environment, but unwilling
exiles, leaving all they held dear, and murmuring
secretly, if not openly, against Fate, presented no
cheering features. The weather was cold and stormy;
while, in crossing the Bay of Biscay, such a wild
outcry of wind and wave greeted them, that with
battened-down hatches, a deeply laden vessel, frightened
passengers and overworked stewards, he had every
facility afforded him for speculation as to whether his
Antarctic enterprise would not be prematurely accounted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

for by a telegram in the <cite>Times</cite>, headed "Another
shipwreck. All hands supposed to be lost."</p>

<p>This, and other discouraging thoughts, passed
through the mind of the voyager during the forty-eight
hours of supreme discomfort, not unmingled with
danger, while the gale ceased not to menace the
labouring vessel. However, being what is called "a
good sailor," and his present frame of mind rendering
him resigned, if not defiant, he endeared himself to
the officers by refraining from useless questions, and
awaiting with composure the change which, as they
were not fated to go to the bottom on that occasion,
took place in due course. How the storm abated,
how the weather cleared; how, as the voyage progressed,
the passengers became companionable, has
often been narrated in similar chronicles.</p>

<p>The mountains of New Zealand were finally sighted,
and the good ship <i>Arrawatta</i> steamed into the lovely
harbour of Auckland one fine morning, presenting to
the eager gaze of the wayfarers the charms of a landscape
which in many respects equals, and in others
surpasses, the world-famed haven of Sydney.</p>

<p>It was early dawn when they floated through the
Rangitoto channel between the island so called&mdash;the
three-coned peak of which, with scoria-shattered
flanks, denoted volcanic origin&mdash;and the North Head.
Passing this guardian headland, "a most living landscape,"
the more entrancing from contrast to the
endless ocean plain which for so many a day had
limited his vision, was spread out before the voyager's
eager and delighted gaze. Land and water, hill and
dale, bold headlands and undulating verdurous slopes,
combined to form a panorama of enchanting variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The city of Auckland, which he had come so far
to see, rose in a succession of graduated eminences
from the waters of a sheltered bay. Bold headlands
alternated with winding creeks and estuaries; low
volcanic hills clothed with dazzling verdure, ferny
glens and copses which reminded him of the last
day's "cock" shooting at the Court; while trim
villas and even more pretentious mansions gave
assurance that here the modern Vikings, having
wearied of the stormy seas, had made themselves a
settled home and abiding-place. Glen and pine-crested
headland, yellow beach and frowning cliff,
wharves and warehouses, skiffs and coasters, the
smoke of steamers, all told of the adjuncts of the
Anglo-Saxon&mdash;that absorbing race which has rarely
been dislodged from suitable foothold.</p>

<p>On the voyage Massinger had noticed a good-looking
man, about his own age, in whom, in spite
of studiously plain attire, he recognized, by various
slight marks and tokens, the English aristocrat. Most
probably the stranger had made similar deductions,
as he had commenced their first conversation with an
unreserved condemnation of the weather, after a passing
depreciation of the food, concluding by a query in the
guise of a statement.</p>

<p>"Not been this way before?"</p>

<p>Massinger admitted the fact.</p>

<p>"Going to settle&mdash;farm&mdash;sheep and all that&mdash;take
up land, eh!"</p>

<p>"I thought of doing so, unless I change my plans
on arrival. I suppose it's as good as any of the
Australian colonies?"</p>

<p>"Beastly holes, generally speaking, for a man who's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

lived in the world. Don't know that New Zealand's
worse than the rest of the lot. Australia&mdash;all black
fellows&mdash;kangaroos&mdash;sandy wastes&mdash;droughts and
floods. Burnt up first&mdash;flood comes and drowns
survivors. So they tell me!"</p>

<p>"But New Zealand is fertile and well watered;
all the books say so."</p>

<p>"Books d&mdash;&mdash;d rot&mdash;lies, end to end; must go
yourself to find out. My third trip."</p>

<p>"Then you like it?" pursued the emigrant, stimulated
by this wholesale depreciation of a country which
all other accounts represented as the Promised Land.</p>

<p>"Have to like it," answered the other; "billet in
this infernal New Zealand Company. Wish I'd broke
my leg the day I applied. Heard of it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Mr. Massinger had indeed heard of it. Had read blue-books,
correspondence, letters, articles, and reviews, in
which the New Zealand Land Company was alternately
represented as a providential agency for saving the
finest country in the world for British occupation, for
finding homes on smiling farms for the crowded population
of Great Britain, for Christianizing the natives
as well as instructing them in the arts of peace; or,
as a syndicate of greedy monopolists, insidiously working
for the accumulation of vast estates, and oppressing
a noble and interesting race, whose lands they proposed
to confiscate under a miserable pretence of sale and
barter.</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> heard and read a good deal of the proceedings
of the New Zealand Land Company; but accounts
differ, so that they are perplexing to a stranger."</p>

<p>"Naturally; all interested people&mdash;one myself," said
his new acquaintance. "But, as we've got so far,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>

permit me?" and extracting a card from a neat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-monnaie</i>,
he handed it to Massinger, who, glancing at
it, perceived the name of</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Mr. Dudley Slyde</span>,<br />
<i>Secretary to the New Zealand Land Company,<br />
Auckland and Christchurch.</i>
</p>

<p>"Happy to make your acquaintance," he said. "I
am not sure that I have a card. My name is
Massinger."</p>

<p>"What! Massinger of the Court, Herefordshire?
Heard generally you had sold your place and gone
in for colonizing. What the devil&mdash;er&mdash;excuse me.
Reasons, no doubt; but if I had the luck to be the
owner of Massinger Court&mdash;<em>born</em> to it, mind you&mdash;I'd
have seen all the colonies swallowed up by an earthquake
before I'd have left England. No! not for all
New Zealand, from the 'Three Kings' to Cape
Palliser."</p>

<p>"If all Englishmen felt alike in that respect, we
shouldn't have had an empire, should we?" suggested
the other. "Somebody must take the chances of war
and adventure."</p>

<p>"<em>Somebody else</em> it would have been in my case,"
promptly replied Mr. Slyde. "However, matter of
taste. Every man manage his own affairs. Great
maxim. And as mine are mixed up in this blessed
company, if you'll look me up in Auckland, I'll put
you up to a wrinkle or two in the matter of land-purchase&mdash;of
course you'll want to buy land; otherwise
<em>you</em> might get sold&mdash;you see? Stock Exchange
with a 'boom' on nothing to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The transfer of Mr. Massinger's trunks in a
four-wheeler to a comfortable-appearing hostelry was
effected with no more than average delay. An
appetizing breakfast, wherein a well-cooked mutton
chop was preceded by a grilled flounder, and flanked
by eggs and toast, convinced him that the Briton
of the South had no occasion to fear degeneration
as a consequence of unsuitable living. After which
he felt his spirits distinctly improved in tone, and his
desire to explore the surroundings of this distant outpost
of the wandering Briton took shape and motion.</p>

<p>The town of Auckland, having a few reasonably
good buildings and a large number of cottages, cabins,
and other shelters in every gradation, from the incipient
terrace to the Maori "whare," was about the average
size of English country towns. No great difference
in the number of houses. Not much in that of the
inhabitants. But there was an unmistakable departure
in the air and bearing of these last. The
recognized orders and classes of British life, hardly
distinguishable from their British types, were all
there. Rich and poor, gentle and simple. The
farmer, the country gentleman, the tradesman, the
lounger, the doctor, the banker, the merchant, the
peasant, and the navvy, all were there, with their
pursuits and avocations written in large text on form
and face, speech and bearing. But he marked, as
before stated, a certain departure from the home
manner. And it was grave and essential. Whether
high or low, each man's features in that heterogeneous
crowd were informed, even illumined, with the glow
of hope, the light of sanguine expectation.</p>

<p>Once landed on the shores of this magnificent

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

appanage of Britain, so nearly lost to the empire,
dull must he be of soul, narrow of vision, who did
not feel his heart bound within him and each pulse
throb at the thought of the gorgeous possibilities
which lay before him. Before the labourer, who
received a fourfold wage, and rejoiced in such
plenteous provision for his family as he had never
dreamed of in the mother-land. Before the farmer,
who saw his way to opulence and landed estate, as
he surveyed the transplanted food crops growing
and burgeoning as in a glorified garden which "drank
the rains of heaven at will." Before the professional
man, whose high fees and abundant practice would
soon absolve him from the necessity of professional
toil. Before the capitalist, who saw in the steady
rise of land-values, whether in town or country, an
illimitable field for judicious investment, ending with
an early retirement and at least <em>one</em> fortune.</p>

<p>The town sloped upwards from the sea, thus
necessitating steep gradients for the streets. The
main street, broad and well laid out, was more level
at its inception, though Massinger saw by the hill
immediately above it that he would not have to go
far before his Alpine experiences would stand him
in good stead. This was entirely to his mind; so,
stepping out with determination, he reached the
summit of Mount Eden. Here he paused, and
indeed the pace at which he had breasted the ascent,
after the inaction of the voyage, rendered it far from
inexpedient to admire the view. What a prospect
it was! He stood upon an isthmus with an ocean
on either hand. Far as eye could range, the boundless
South Pacific lay glowing and shimmering under

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

the midday sun; on the hither side, the harbour
with flags of all nations and ships from every sea.</p>

<p>The roadstead by which the <i>Arrawatta</i> had
entered, appeared like a land-locked inlet. The
outlines of the Greater and Lesser Barrier were
plainly visible, as also the lofty ridge of Cape Colville;
other islands and headlands loomed faintly
in the shadowy horizon. Westward lay the great
harbour of Manukau and the Waitakerei Ranges.</p>

<p>Weary with scanning the gulfs of the Hauraki
and Waitemata, as also the far-seen ranges of the
Upper Thames, holding stores of precious minerals,
he allowed his eye to rest upon the fields and farmhouses,
villages and meadows, overspreading the
levels and sheltered beneath the volcanic hills.
Under his feet what marvellous revelations of fertility
met his gaze! The volcanic formation was evidenced
by the shape of the conical eminences by which he
was surrounded. He counted more than a dozen.
In all, the extinct craters were perfect in form, though
covered on side and base with richest herbage. In
these he detected most of the British fodder plants,
growing in unusual luxuriance. Observing the flattened
summits and remains of graded terraces, he
found on inspection that the hand of man had adapted
these works of nature to his needs.</p>

<p>Scarped, terraced, and perfect of circumvallation,
the remains of mouldering palisades indicated the
abodes of a warlike people, who had in long-past
days converted these hilltops into fortresses, affording
effective means of defence, as well as a wide outlook,
in case of invasion.</p>

<p>Here for generations, perhaps centuries uncounted,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

had this vigorous, agricultural, warlike people&mdash;for
such by his course of reading he knew the Maori
nation to be&mdash;lived and died, fought and feasted,
garnered their simple harvest, and lived contentedly
on the products of land and sea.</p>

<p>Proud and stubborn, brave to recklessness, they
naturally became jealous of the gradually extending
occupation of their land by the encroaching white
race. But why should such a people not be sensitive,
even to the madness of battle, against overwhelming
odds? They had won their country from the deep,
traversing wide wastes of waters in canoes but ill
adapted for storm and tempest. They had discovered
this fair region&mdash;cultivated, peopled it. Why should
they not resist a foreign occupation to the death?
And as he looked around on the magnificent prospect
spread before, around, he could not help recalling the
lines of the immortal bard&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem" >
<div class="stanza">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Where's the coward that would not dare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To fight for such a land?"</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Returning to his hotel, he chanced to meet
several groups of this much-exploited people, and
was much impressed by the stalwart frames and bold,
independent bearing of the men.</p>

<p>Many of the women, too, were handsome, and
among the half-caste girls and young men were forms
and faces which would have compared favourably
with the finest models of ancient Greece. One young
man of that colour attracted his attention. He had
been reading on board ship that wonderful romance
of Michael Scott's, wherein the spacious times of old,
and the planter-life of the West Indian Islands, are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>

limned with such prodigality of colour, such wealth
of humorous perception, such power of pathos. As
this young man came swinging along with a companion
down the street, cigar in mouth, he could not
help saying to himself, "There's the young pirate
captain out of 'Tom Cringle's Log.'" He was taller
even than that fascinating Spanish desperado, but
there was a strong family likeness.</p>

<p>"What a man he is!" thought Massinger. "Six
feet three or four, if an inch, broad-shouldered, deep-chested&mdash;a
wondrous combination of strength and
activity; supple as a panther, with the muscle of a
Farnese Hercules. As to his features, the eyes and
teeth are splendid, the complexion a clear bronze,
hardly darker than that of Southern Europe."</p>

<p>Altogether he doubted if he had ever seen such
a remarkable masculine specimen of personal grace
and beauty. "This is truly a remarkable country,"
he soliloquized. "If the climate and soil can raise
men like this, what may not be hoped from the
introduction of a purely British race, with all the
modern advantages of civilization?"</p>

<p>Thus pondering, he managed to discover his hotel,
where he set himself resolutely to sketch out a plan
of future operation, before completing which, he
deemed it advisable to deliver some of the letters
of introduction with which he had been plentifully
supplied. One of the more immediate effects of this
action was the outflow of an inordinate quantity of
advice, from the recipients of which, as a newly arrived
Englishman, he was deemed to be in urgent need.</p>

<p>These exhortations were compendious and exhaustive,
but failed in effect upon him from their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>

very affluence, so much of the suggestive information
being in direct contrast to that which immediately
preceded it.</p>

<p>Having admitted that he intended to purchase a
large block of land for farm and grazing purposes, it
was astonishing how much interest he excited among
the mercantile or pastoral magnates to whom he had
been accredited.</p>

<p>"Have nothing to do with that infernal New
Zealand Company," said one grizzled colonist, "or
you'll never cease to regret it. They're all in the
same boat with certain British members of Parliament
and the local political gang, to rob these poor devils
of natives of their tribal lands. Title? They haven't
a rag. Some artful devil of a Maori&mdash;and they are
not behindhand in that line&mdash;pretends to sell the
lands of his tribe, for a few barrels of gunpowder or
cases of Yankee axes&mdash;of course signs a bogus deed."</p>

<p>"But isn't he their accredited agent?" queried
our hero. "They would be bound by his act."</p>

<p>"Agent be hanged!" quoth the pioneer impetuously.
"This allotment belongs to me; have I
a right therefore to sell the whole town? Though,
between you and me, there are men in business here
who would have a try at it, if they could delude one
of you innocent new arrivals into taking his word
and paying over the cash."</p>

<p>"I trust I'm not quite so innocent," replied
Massinger, smiling, "as to make purchases without
due inquiry."</p>

<p>"Depends upon whom you inquire from," said
his experienced friend. "Advice is cheap, or rather
dear enough, when the giver has an axe to grind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then how am I to find out, if no one is to be
trusted in this Arcadia of yours?"</p>

<p>"Devilish few that I know of," rejoined the senior.
"The Government officials and the Land Commissioners
are, perhaps, the safest. They have some
character to lose, and are fairly impartial."</p>

<p>"After what you have said, may I venture to ask
counsel from you?"&mdash;instinctively trusting the open
countenance and steady eye of the pioneer.</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly; you needn't take it, of course.
Don't be in a hurry to invest; that's my first word.
The next, <em>buy from the Government</em>; they have a title&mdash;that
is, nearly always&mdash;and are bound to support
you in it."</p>

<p>"But suppose their title is disputed? What will
they do?"</p>

<p>"Take forcible possession, which means <em>war</em>.
And Maori war&mdash;savages, as it's the fashion industry call
them&mdash;is no joke. And mark my word, if they're
not more careful than they have been lately, 'the deil
will gae ower Jock Wabster.'" Here the speaker
lapsed into his native Doric, showing that though
half a century had rolled by since he first anchored
in the Bay of Islands, and the Southern tongue had
encroached somewhat, he had not forgotten the hills
of bonnie Scotland or the expressive vernacular of his
youth.</p>

<p>"But surely the tribe, whichever it may happen to
be, could not stand against British regulars?"</p>

<p>"So you may think. But I was in the thick of
Honi Heke's affair in '45, and I could tell you stories
that would surprise you. You must remember that,
as a people, the New Zealanders are among the most

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>

warlike races upon earth, inured for centuries past to
every species of bloodshed and rapine, and bred up
in the belief that a man is a warrior or nothing.
Fear, they know not the name of. They are wily
strategists, as you will observe, when you see their
'pahs,' and the nature of their primeval forests gives
them an immense advantage for cover or concealment."</p>

<p>"Then you think there may be another war?"
inquired Massinger, with some interest.</p>

<p>"Think! I'm sure of it. Things can't go on as
they are. We're in for it sooner or later, and all
because the Governor, who means well, lets himself be
led by half a dozen politicians, in spite of the advice
of the old hands and the friendly chiefs, our allies,
who have as much sense and policy as all the ministry
put together."</p>

<p>"But will not they always naturally lean to their
own countrymen?"</p>

<p>"Far from it&mdash;that's the very reason. Most of
these chiefs have tribal feuds and hereditary enemies,
as bitter and remorseless as ever my Hieland ancestors
enjoyed themselves with. Others, like Waka Nene,
since they were Christianized by the early missionaries,
have cast in their lot with the whites. They
fought shoulder to shoulder with us, and will again,
even if they disapprove of our policy."</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary people!" said Massinger.
"And if war breaks out, as you think likely, what will
become of the colonists?"</p>

<p>"They will have to fight for it. Murders and every
kind of devilry will result. But we have fought before,
and can again, I suppose. These islands are going
to be another Britain; and even if there has been some

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

folly and injustice, England always means well, and
we are not going to give them up. 'No, sir,' as my
American friends say."</p>

<p>"I rather like the prospect," said Massinger. "A
good straightforward war is a novelty in these too-peaceful
days. If I had any notion of leaving New
Zealand, which I have not, this would decide me.
Good morning, and many thanks. I will see you
again before I decide on anything fresh."</p>

<p>"There's grit in that young yellow," quoth the
ex-skipper, as he walked out. "Bar accidents, he's the
sort of man to make his mark in a new country."</p>

<p>The man so referred to walked down the street,
deeply pondering.</p>

<p>"I have got into the land of romance," thought he,
"without any manner of doubt. What a pull for a
fellow in these degenerate days! It raises one's
spirits awfully. In addition to such a country for
grass and roots as I never dreamt of it, to think of
there being every probability of a war! A real
war! It reminds one of the 'Last of the Mohicans,'
and all the joys of youth. We shall have 'Hawkeye,'
'Uncas,' and 'Chingachgook' turning up before we
know where we are. Oh! <i>fortunati nimium</i>&mdash;&mdash;Halloa!
what have we here?"</p>

<p>What he saw at that moment was something which
had hardly entered into his calculations as a peaceful
colonist. But it was strangely in accord with the
warning tone of Captain Macdonald's last deliverance.
A section of the Ngatiawa tribe, which had visited
Auckland on the matter of a petition to the Governor
concerning the violation of a reserve, the same being
<i>tapu</i> under ceremonies of a particularly awful and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

sacred nature, were indulging themselves with a war-dance
by way of dissipating the tedium necessitated
by official delay. A crowd of the townspeople had
collected at the corner of Shortland Street, while the
tattooed braves were with the utmost gravity going
through the evolutions of their horrific performance.
Chiefly unclothed, they stamped and roared, grimaced
and threatened, as in actual preparation for conflict.
Musket in hand, they leaped and yelled like demoniacs;
their countenances distorted, the eyes turned inward,
their tongues protruded as with wolfish longing. Each
man was possessed by a fiend, as it seemed to
Massinger, who gazed upon the actors with intense
interest. The performance, hardly new to the majority
of the spectators, failed to impress one of them with
due respect. He remarked upon the pattern tattooed
on the thigh of a huge native in front of him to a
comrade, ending with a rude jest in the Maori tongue.
It was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise plaisanterie</i> in good sooth. Turning
like a wild bull upon the astonished offender,
and furious at the insult offered to his <i>moko</i>&mdash;sacred
as the totem of an Indian chief&mdash;the Ngatiawa
dashed the butt-end of his musket against his breast,
sending him on to his back with such violence that
he had to be assisted to rise, stunned and bewildered.
The Maoris wheeled like one man, and formed in line,
while the leader shouted <i>Kapai!</i> as they marched
through the crowd to their camp, chanting a refrain
which no doubt might have been freely rendered,
"Wha daur meddle wi' me?"</p>

<p>This incident impressed our Englishman more than
weeks of description could have done, with the peculiar
characteristics of the strange race among whom

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>

he had elected to dwell. Pride and sensitiveness, to
the point of frenzy, were evidently among the attributes
which had to be considered at risk of personal
damage.</p>

<p>He was, however, surprised at the cool way in
which the crowd had taken their comrade's discomfiture,
and said as much to a respectable-looking man
who was walking down the street with him.</p>

<p>"We're not afraid of the beggars," returned the
townsman, "as we'll show 'em by-and-by. But it's
no good starting before you're ready. That fellow
was half-drunk, and it served him right. There's a
big tribe at the back of these chaps, and they're in a
dangerous humour about that cursed Waitara block.
That's why the crowd wouldn't back the white man
up. He's only a wharf-loafer, when all's said and
done."</p>

<p>This explained the affair in great part. Doubtless
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> would have ensued if any hot-blooded individuals
in the street had commenced an attack upon
the Maoris. An obstinate and by no means bloodless
fight must have arisen. Doubtless, in the end, the
whites would have conquered. Then the tribe would
have murdered outlying settlers, or attacked the town.
The military would have been engaged. The war-torch,
once applied, might have lighted up a conflagration
over the whole island, necessitating an expenditure
of blood and treasure which years of peace would have
been insufficient to repay. All, too, occasioned by the
idiotic folly of a worthless member of society.</p>

<p>Revolving such reflections, which, with other ideas
and considerations, effectually excluded the image of
Hypatia, Roland Massinger betook himself to his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>

hotel, having discovered, as many a gentleman unfortunate
in his love affairs has done before him, that
this life of ours holds sensational interests, which, if
not sufficing to assuage the pangs of unrequited love,
yet act as a potent anodyne.</p>

<p>To such an extent did the subject of the
diplomacy urgently required at such a juncture
excite his interest, that he cast about for some
means of visiting the camp of these strange people,
and learning more about their embassy, which had
so suddenly acquired importance in his eyes. Having
fully decided upon making New Zealand his home,
and becoming fired with ambition to aid in the
development of this wonderland of the South, he
had addressed himself on the voyage with commendable
diligence to the study of the Maori
language and traditions. Thus, though properly diffident
as to his colloquial powers, he was in a position
to more easily acquire a practical proficiency than if
he had been without a preparatory course of study.</p>

<p>He had finished his lunch, and was enjoying his
smoke on the balcony, gazing over the harbour,
of which the elevated position of the Grand Hotel
offered a view which he never ceased to admire,
when he recognized the sonorous voice of his marine
friend of the morning, Captain Macdonald.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! Ticklish situation&mdash;you may well
say so. Jack Maori sitting on a powder barrel, filling
cartridges and smoking his pipe. I've often seen 'em&mdash;nothing
to it."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Macdonald; you and I have
been long enough here to know how to deal with
Maoris. The Government ought to see that the touchy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

beggars are not needlessly set up. I lost a dozen
valuable blocks here in 1840 because a young fool
of a pakeha didn't know the difference between taihai-ing
(stealing) and mere taking away&mdash;tiaki-ing."</p>

<p>"Why, how was that?"</p>

<p>"Well, he said that Te Hira, the young chief of
all the coast about there, was 'taihai-ing the goahore'&mdash;instead
of tiaki-ing. He felt affronted&mdash;sulked,
of course, and just as I fully expected to get all
Shortland Crescent for&mdash;well, decidedly cheap&mdash;he
shut up his mouth like a vice, and wouldn't sell a
yard of his land. It shows what a queer people they
are, when a grammatical error has such far-reaching
consequences."</p>

<p>"Consequences!" echoed his companion; "I should
think so. But I never heard of that adventure of
yours."</p>

<p>"Well, it made a difference of about five thousand
a year to me, according to the present price of the
land. The Government got it afterwards, and cut it
up into town lots. What noble buildings are on
them now!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Lochiel," said the sea-captain;
"suppose we walk over to the camp and have a
<i>Kor&#466;ero</i>. I know this chief, and we can both patter
Maori. It might do good to explain matters, and
none of us want to see Auckland under martial law."</p>

<p>"It's just a grand idea!" said the other colonist,
a tall distinguished-looking elderly man, whose spare
upright figure suggested military training; once careless
enough of danger, but now for some years declined
to the more peaceful vocation of a merchant&mdash;one of
the sea-roving, fearless breed of adventurers peculiar to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>

Britain, whose wide-reaching mercantile transactions
have included the mobilizing of armies and the levying
of taxes; "in whose lumber-rooms," as in those
of the Great Company now merged in Imperial rule,
"are the thrones of ancient kings."</p>

<p>Here Massinger advanced, and bringing himself
within the ken of the speakers, was at once introduced
to "my old friend, Mr. Lochiel," as "Mr. Massinger,
a gentleman who had come to settle among them."</p>

<p>"Very pleased to make his acquaintance," said
the tall man, whose shrewd, intellectual, kindly face
impressed him most favourably. "If he is of my
mind, he will have reason to congratulate himself
on his choice of a colony. I have never regretted
my decision, and the greater part of my life has
been spent here."</p>

<p>"You seem to have a diplomatic difficulty on
hand," remarked Massinger, "if I may judge from
an experience this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh! you witnessed that affair in Shortland Street,
did you? My friend and I were just about to walk
over to the Maori camp and get their notion of it.
We're both 'Pakeha Maoris' of long standing, and
the chief, Te Rangitake, has heard our names before.
Would you care to accompany us?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing I should like better. I begin
to wish for a more intimate acquaintance with our
native friends, and trust to be an authority on their
manners and customs by-and-by."</p>

<p>"It's odds but that we may know a lot more
about their ways before long," said Captain Macdonald;
"more than we shall like, if I don't mistake. In the
mean time we had better look them up at the Kiki."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The newly made friends&mdash;for such they were fated
to be in the after-time&mdash;walked on a path parallel to
the sea, over several deep ravines crossed by temporary
bridges, until they came to a clear space, in front of
which a bold bluff looked out upon the harbour.
Here a collection of huts, made of the <i>raupo</i>, or
reed-rush, and the smoke of fires, denoted the
presence of the ambassadors of the former lords of
the soil.</p>

<p>"<i>Haere Mai! Haere Mai!</i>" was the cry with
which they were greeted, which Massinger rightly
interpreted as a note of welcome. His companions
replied with a phrase which appeared to be the
correct antiphonal rejoinder. As they reached the
camp, in which they noted a number of women and
children, it was evident that they were favourably
known to the <i>hapu</i>, or family section, of the by no
means inconsiderable Ngatiawa tribe.</p>

<p>The chief himself, an intelligent and determined-looking
man, thus addressed them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Welcome! My welcome is to you, captain! You
have been a friend to the Ngatiawa as long ago as
when Honii Heke cut down the flagstaff; and my
welcome is to you&mdash;Herekino. When your ship was
in Kororarika, your heart was to our tribe."</p>

<p>"My salutation," said Macdonald, "is to you, O
Te Rangitake! My friend and I, also this Pakeha
Rangatira, have come to you for words in this quarrel
of Otakou in Auckland today. It is folly&mdash;let it
not breed quarrels between us. It was the act of a
nobody, a <i>tutua</i>.</p>

<p>"The heart of Otakou is sore," replied the chief,
gravely. "He was mocked by the pakeha. His

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

<i>mana</i> was injured. He wished for <i>utu</i>, but I
told him there were matters to be considered; that
the tribe was in <i>runanga</i> concerning the Waitara
land&mdash;our land, the land of my people. After that
he can take his musket in his hand. It is his own
affair."</p>

<p>"It was a folly, a child's trick. The pakeha
was beaten by him. He fell on the ground. His
countrymen would not defend him. He had done
wrong. Were they afraid of forty or fifty Maoris?
No! They knew that the pakeha had done wrong.
They would not lift a finger for him."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the chief; and advancing a few
steps, he spoke rapidly to the insulted warrior, who
sat moodily alone. "The Rangatira with the white
man says the pakeha has done wrong. His people
disown him. The matter is ended." Here he broke
a wand which he carried in his hand in two pieces,
in token that the decision was complete. Upon
which the countenance of the insulted Maori cleared
visibly; he arose, and walked to the other side of
the camp.</p>

<p>And now Mr. Lochiel commenced a conversation
in Maori with the chief, which evidently was more
important, and, as it proceeded, became deeply
interesting. The flashing eye of the chief, his
impetuous words, his frowning brow, and ever and
anon the deep, resonant tones of his voice, intimated
so much.</p>

<p>Captain Macdonald translated from time to time,
for the information of Massinger, who became anxious
to learn more of the subject of the important conference,
for such it evidently was. The colonist spoke

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>

calmly, but with weight and effect, as was shown by
the quick rejoinders and deeply moved expression of
countenance of his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"It is about this Waitara block which the Government
has bought lately," said Captain Macdonald.
"He disputes the right of Teira to sell it; says that
he will <i>not</i> acknowledge any sale or transfer. That
the land belongs, in named and measured portions, to
individuals and families in the tribe. That no single
person has the right to dispose of it. That the whole
tribe must unite, and through him, their chief and
<i>Ariki</i>, give formal assent to the sale. That he is
anxious to be at peace with the Governor and our
people, but that he will shed his blood rather than
part with this land."</p>

<p>"But surely there must have been official correspondence
about the sale of this important block?"
said Massinger. "Land is not handed over anywhere
like a ton of potatoes."</p>

<p>"To do the Government justice, there has been
correspondence enough and to spare," replied Mr.
Lochiel. "The chief says he had a letter from the
Colonial Secretary that Teira's land (as alleged) would
be bought by the Governor. That his rule was that
each man was to have the 'word' about his own land&mdash;that
the word of a man with no claim would not be
listened to."</p>

<p>"But that is the whole business, as I understand
the matter. The chief says it is <i>not</i> the seller's land,
though he may have a separate portion."</p>

<p>"That is what Te Rangitake wrote. 'Friend!
Salutation to you! I will not agree to our bedroom
being sold (I mean Waitara here), for this bed belongs

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

to the whole of us! And do not you be in haste to give
the money. If you give the money in secret, you will
get no land. Do not suppose that this is folly on my
part. All I have to say to you, O Governor! is that
none of this land will be given to you&mdash;<i>akore, akore,
akore</i> (never, never, never)&mdash;while I live.'"</p>

<p>As these words rang out until they reached a shout
of defiance, the greater part of the assembled warriors
started to their feet, and standing round their chief and
the three white men, looked as if but a very little
additional excitement would suffice to lead them to
death or glory, commencing with the slaughtering of
any chance pakehas whom they might meet.</p>

<p>"This was not by any means intended for a declaration
of war," Mr. Lochiel averred. "The Maoris are
very demonstrative in oratory, and have always been
in the habit of using much parliamentary discussion;
even of giving full and official notice before war is
actually declared."</p>

<p>But as the three Europeans wended their way back
to the city, the countenances of the older men expressed
grave doubt&mdash;even expectation of evil.</p>

<p>"As sure as we stand here," said Mr. Lochiel, coming
to a halt, and looking over the waters of the harbour,
lying calm and peaceful in the rich tints of the setting
sun, "and as certainly as that sun will rise tomorrow,
there will be trouble&mdash;war to the knife, I believe&mdash;if
the Government persists in paying that fellow Teira
the cash and claiming the whole block."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said his friend. "How the
Governor, who has stood firm in so many similar
cases, should have allowed himself to be hoodwinked
in this, passes my knowledge. These Ngatiawas will

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

refuse to quit their land; and the moment the surveyors
go on it, there will be the devil to pay."</p>

<p>"But what can they do?" queried Massinger.
"Will they kill the survey party?"</p>

<p>"No! certainly not. They rarely act in a hurry.
They will probably use merely passive resistance at
first. But resist they will. You may take their oath
of that."</p>

<p>"And if that has no effect?"</p>

<p>"Then they will fight in earnest. They are devils
incarnate when their blood is up. I have seen many
an inter-tribal raid and battle; I don't wish to see
another. But there will be murder in cold blood&mdash;killing
in hot blood, with all the devilry of savage
warfare. The blood of the men, women, and children
certain to be sacrificed before the campaign is over,
will be on the heads of those whose folly and greed
provoke the outbreak."</p>

<p>"And is there no means of arresting this mad
action?" said the younger man. "Will not leading
colonists take the initiative in preventing a flagrant
injustice&mdash;this removal of landmarks which must be
paid for in blood?"</p>

<p>"All depends upon whether the peace party in the
House is strong enough to defeat the machinery of the
land-jobbers. If not, one thing is certain. We shall
see the beginning of a war of which it will be hard to
predict the end&mdash;much more what may happen in the
meantime. And now, if you and my old friend here
will dine with me this evening, I will promise not to
sell you any land, or otherwise take advantage of your
presumed inexperience as a newly arrived lamb among
us wolves of colonists."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could possibly have been suggested more
in accordance with our hero's tastes and inclinations,
and he congratulated himself on his prospects of gaining
real reliable acquaintance with New Zealand
politics. This arrangement was duly carried out, and
the three friends walked together to Mr. Lochiel's
house. He had begged them to dispense with any
change of attire, as the dusk was closing in and Mrs.
Lochiel was absent on a visit. When they reached
the mansion, beautifully situated on a headland overlooking
the harbour, its size and appointments were
a surprise to Massinger, doubtful of the class of habitation
which they were approaching.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the venerable pioneer, as they stood in
the handsomely furnished drawing-room, replete with
pictures, casts, curios&mdash;a most generous assortment of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">objets d'art</i>, evidently the fruits of a lengthened
continental ramble; "things are much changed since
Thornton and I bought that island you see out under
the line of moon-rays, from the reigning chief, more
than thirty years ago. He and I lived there for many
a day, chiefly upon pork, fish, potatoes, and oysters.
How well I remember the good old chief, to whom
we 'belonged' as Pakeha Maoris, and the first night
we spent there!"</p>

<p>"And at that time had none of the land here been
sold to the Government?" asked Massinger.</p>

<p>"Not one solitary acre, where Auckland now
stands&mdash;'nor roof, nor latched door,' to quote the old
song. And now, look at it."</p>

<p>Mr. Massinger did look across the suburb which
divided the grounds of their host's residence from the
city of Auckland, with its thirty thousand inhabitants,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

its churches, gardens, court-houses, public libraries,
vice-regal mansion, and warehouses. The lights of
the city showed an area even larger than he had at
first supposed it to be. The ships in the well-filled
harbour, the steamers with their variously coloured
illuminants, completed the picture of a thriving settlement,
destined to perform its function notably as a
component part of the British Empire.</p>

<p>"This is hardly progress," he exclaimed. "It is
<em>transformation</em>!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fully</span> convinced that it behoved him to walk warily,
and to consider well before he committed himself to
a purchase involving the investment of his capital and
the necessity of residence in a district which might be
exposed to the horrors of war, Massinger determined
to consult all available friends and acquaintances, as
well as to examine for himself. He wished to make
sure not only of the validity of title, but of all collateral
conditions likely to affect his occupation. Still, an
estate of some sort he was determined to acquire.</p>

<p>He had taken daily walks in every direction from
his headquarters, and the more he saw of this wonderful
country, the more favourably he was disposed to think
of its fertility, salubrity, and general adaptation to
the needs of an Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>"What an astonishing thing it seems," he told
himself, musingly, "that these marvellous islands
should have remained unknown, unoccupied wastes,
and, but for a few tribes of splendid barbarians, unpeopled,
until the early years of the present century!
Providence has marked them out for another home of
our restless race. Another England, beneath the Cross
of the South! An outlet, how gracious and timely,
for the 'hardly entreated brother' who so often

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>

languishes in older lands for lack of free scope for his
energies! Such soil, such rivers, such scenery, such
a climate! What should we think at home if tens
of thousands of acres of land of this quality were
offered to our farmers at peppercorn rents or nominal
purchase-money?"</p>

<p>Then, not intending to confine himself entirely to
one set of advisers, he decided to look up Mr. Dudley
Slyde. He found that gentleman in an upper chamber
of a large building, writing letters which looked like
despatches, with an industry in strong contrast to his
<i>dolce far niente</i> attitude during the voyage. However,
he promptly relinquished his task, and, taking a chair
near a press marked "Native Titles," drew forth a
box of cigars, and, lighting one, exhorted his guest
to do the same.</p>

<p>"Writing home," he said apologetically; "last day
of the mail&mdash;have to send all sorts of beastly Reports.
Just told my directors country's going to the devil;
wrapped it up decently, of course. Bad business, this
Waitara block&mdash;shockingly managed; don't half like
the look of things. Heard of it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I witnessed a passage of arms also
between one of the Maori deputation and a drunken
white man. It appeared to me significant of the
temper of the native population."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;d bad temper generally. Touchy first, and
dangerous, not to say bloodthirsty, afterwards. Queer
people."</p>

<p>"In some respects, certainly. But is there no way
of persuading them to sell their land? It would be
better for them and everybody else not to lock up
this fertile country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course there is, if you go the right way about it.
But can't be done by main force. Wants brains and
straight going. That's what we're short of. Governor
right enough, if it comes to that, but been 'had' in
this last affair."</p>

<p>"The Waitara block?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. I see you're getting colonized. Remember
what Bailey Junior said about Mrs. Todgers'
fish?"</p>

<p>"'Don't eat none of it?' I remember. But how
does that apply?"</p>

<p>"Just this much. Don't you touch an acre of that
rich and well-watered area, if you get it for nothing.
There'll be bloodshed over it, take my word. And
carrying on Master Bailey's warning, any eating done
on the premises is more likely than not to be at the
expense, literally and <em>personally</em>, of the incautious
purchaser."</p>

<p>"In my&mdash;I was going to say, in my opinion&mdash;but
I refrain, being unable to form one. But perhaps I
may go so far as to quote old colonists&mdash;that there
is certain to be trouble if this so-called purchase is
attempted to be carried out. At this stage could it
not be prevented?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly it could; but when a policy has
been weak up to a certain point, the responsible head
is apt to square the account by being obstinate in the
wrong place. That's the matter now."</p>

<p>"And the end?"</p>

<p>"God only knows. If the Government persists in
pushing through this bogus sale, against the warnings
of Te Rangitake&mdash;who, in addition to his being a high
chief, and the largest holder in this said block, is a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>

deuced ugly customer&mdash;I'll lay twenty to one that
there'll be the devil to pay."</p>

<p>"But the Government surely won't call out the
troops in the face of the reports of Busby and McLean,
and the opinion of Maning, anent native titles?"</p>

<p>"People of ordinary sense would think so, but
they're 'running amok' just now, and what between
the Company, the Provincial Council, the Ministry,
and the Governor, who has been over-persuaded or
duped in the matter, I believe that war, and nothing
else, will be the outcome. The British Government
has acquired much territory in different parts of the
world, but this is going to be one of the biggest land-bills
in men and money that Old England ever drew
cheque for. That's what I'm telling my directors at
home, and I hope they'll like the news."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Slyde resumed his pen, and with a brief
adieu the chance friends separated.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Discovering from reliable sources that nothing in
the way of battle, murder, and sudden death was
likely to take place for a few weeks, Mr. Massinger
decided that he would pay a visit to those wondrous
lakes of which he had heard and read. He had
pictured in his mind, how often, the strange aspect
of a country where snow-crowned mountains or active
volcanoes looked down upon Nature's daring colour-effects
dashed off in her most fantastic moods; where
the central fires of the globe sent up their steam in
jets, and the angry gnome, "the mid-earth's swarthy
child," still murmured audibly; where boiling fountains
hissed and gurgled, unchilled by the wintry blast; where
fairy terraces, lustrous in lace-like tracery, lay shining,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

translucent, under summer moon or winter dawn;
where the unsophisticated inhabitants of this weird and
magical region, all ignorant of the clothes philosophy,
revelled from morn to eve in the luxurious warmth of
medicated baths, curative of all the ills that flesh is
heir to.</p>

<p>When he communicated his intentions as to visiting
the far-famed land of the geyser and the fumarole to
his friends, they all advised him to make the journey
without delay.</p>

<p>"It is one of the wonders of the world, and by no
means the least," said Mr. Lochiel. "I thank God
that I have seen it; and though I have travelled much
in other lands, I have never beheld the place that
equals that strange and grand landscape, terrible even
in its beauty. The delicate loveliness of the pink
and white terraces 'beggars all description.' I shall
not attempt it. They alone are well worth coming
from the other end of the world to see."</p>

<p>"And I wouldn't delay either," said Captain
Macdonald. "This Waitara business may bring on
war at any time, and then no white man, except a
missionary, is safe&mdash;hardly he, indeed."</p>

<p>"I will start next week," said Massinger, "if I
can get a horse and guide. I should never forgive
myself if I lost the chance by delay."</p>

<p>"Horses of any kind you can pick up at the bazaar
within an hour," said Mr. Lochiel; "and I will send
you a guide who could find his way to Taupo in the
dark. It is scarcely a road to travel alone just now,
and the forest tracks are neither easy to keep nor to
find again when lost. The rivers, too, are of a violent
nature, and dangerous unless you know the fords."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Acting upon this information and the advice so
freely tendered, Mr. Massinger at once bought himself
a horse. The roads being rough&mdash;indeed, mostly in
a state of nature, as he was informed&mdash;and a certain
amount of wearing apparel and provisions being
absolutely necessary, he looked less to the paces and
appearance of the animal than to its strength and
substance. A guide, too, was essential, as in a country
where the primeval forest was almost impracticable in
places, where the ice-cold rivers were without fords
often, without bridges always, local knowledge was
indispensable. He was fortunate in one respect, as he
fell across a stout half-bred grey mare at a moderate
price.</p>

<p>Something was said to him about the danger of
travelling among the wilder tribes of the north without
protection, or even a comrade of his own race; to which
he made answer that he had not come all that way
to lead a feather-bed life. Whatever risk other men
encountered, he felt equal to. So, with the good
wishes of all whom he had met since his landing, he
prepared to depart.</p>

<p>Mr. Slyde's parting injunction was, "Stand up to
these Maori beggars, and talk as if you owned the
island. They know a gentleman when they see one,
and they hate anything like distrust or double-dealing.
Unless war is declared while you are away, you will
be as safe as in town here; in some respects perhaps
safer. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir.</i>"</p>

<p>In New Zealand at that time, and, indeed, long
afterwards, people were so accustomed to the sight of
the emigrant Briton, with his thick boots, his rough
tweeds, Crimean shirt, and brand-new valise or saddlebags,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

that such an apparition hardly excited more
surprise than in the Australian colonies. There, a
hundred years of colonization have settled the race
in personal habitudes descriptive of every shade of
road travel, town dwelling, ordinary wayfaring or
desert exploration. One glance there is sufficient to
determine, not only the station in life, but the immediate
business or occupation of the stranger. And so
full and continuous had been the stream of emigration
poured into New Zealand of late years, that the
ultra-British rig excited no more remark than that of
the tweed-clad tourist in the Highlands. Even the
"garb of old Gaul," which the clansmen from Aberfoil
or Glengarry not infrequently sported, as useful,
dignified, and ornamental, only received a passing
glance, or gave rise to a transient observation from a
native as to the peculiar description of lunacy to which
the pakehas were subject.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Roland Massinger left Auckland
one fine morning, riding his gallant grey, with the
trusty double-barrel on his shoulder, a navy revolver
in his belt, and a miscellaneous assortment of useful
articles dispersed about himself and his charger, no
one seemed disposed to remark unnecessarily, or to
make jeering remarks upon his outfit.</p>

<p>A day or two before starting, Massinger received a
note in a strange handwriting, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">"Auckland, 14, Shortland Street,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>

<p class="right">"Wednesday.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"My old friend Dr. Lochiel has, I believe,
recommended me to you as a guide for the trip to
Rotorua and Rotomahana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know the country well, and shall be glad to act,
if we can arrange. I don't say that it is too safe in
the present state of native feeling, but that is for you
to judge. I shall have the pleasure of calling upon
you tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">"Yours truly,</p>
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Albert Warwick</span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>"R. Massinger, Esq."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Why, I thought Dr. Lochiel told me that the
guide was a half-caste," said he to himself. "Very
well written and expressed. Some men I know, from
English public schools, too, could not have written
such a note to save their lives. However, I suppose
he got some one to write it for him."</p>

<p>He had finished his breakfast, and was digesting it
and the contents of the <i>New Zealand Herald</i>, besides
trying to reconcile conflicting statements as to the
Native Lands Policy, when a visitor was announced.</p>

<p>"Mr. Massinger, I believe," said the stranger,
bowing. "My name is Warwick; I presume you
received my note yesterday?"</p>

<p>For one moment that gentleman's self-possession
almost failed him, but he recovered himself in time
to murmur an assent and ask the stranger to take a
chair. There was some reason for his surprise.</p>

<p>He saw before him a very good-looking, well-dressed
man of about his own age, turned out much
as he had often been himself for a day's shooting.
A Norfolk jacket, with knickerbockers and worsted
stockings, these last exhibiting a volume of muscular
calf, above laced-up shooting-boots of great strength
and thickness of sole. A wide-brimmed felt hat, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>

a Crimean shirt, completed attire which was eminently
appropriate and serviceable.</p>

<p>"You know the people and the country, as well as
the route to these far-famed lakes?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"From my boyhood," answered this perplexing
personage, with a perfectly correct, even finished
accent, "I have been familiar with both. We have
relatives in the Ngapuhi tribe, and I am always glad
of an excuse to see some wild life among them. I
have occasionally acted as guide to parties of tourists,
and not so long ago to His Excellency the Governor
and his staff."</p>

<p>"And your remuneration?" queried the tourist,
thinking it wise to settle that important question
off-hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, say a guinea a day and expenses paid,"
replied the stranger, in airy, off-hand fashion, as
if the trifling amount was hardly worth mentioning.
"That is my usual fee. I am fond of these expeditions
myself, and in pleasant company; but that one
must live, I should be quite willing to go with you
for nothing."</p>

<p>"That, of course, is not to be thought of. But it will
be an added pleasure to have a companion from whom
I can gain information and share a novel experience."</p>

<p>"Thanks very much," said Mr. Warwick, bowing;
"and for the baggage, if I might advise, the least
possible quantity that you can do with. All beyond
will encumber you in the sort of trail before us. I
should like to superintend the packing."</p>

<p>"Very grateful, if you will," said Massinger. "Perhaps
you would not mind breakfasting with me tomorrow;
we could start directly afterwards."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most happy. In that case, I shall be here at
sunrise, which will give time to arrange the pack,
and we need lose none of the best part of the day."</p>

<p>So much being understood, Mr. Warwick bowed
himself out, leaving his employer in a state of suppressed
astonishment.</p>

<p>"The land of wonders, indeed!" he soliloquized.
"The people, as well as the land, seem mysteries and
enigmas. Only to look at this man is a revelation.
What a handsome fellow he is!&mdash;no darker than a
Spaniard, with regular features and a splendid figure.
He would throw into the shade many of the curled
darlings of the old land. One of his descendants,
having taken high honours at Christ Church University,
is obviously the man Macaulay had in his mind when
he created the immortal New Zealander on London
Bridge. His accent, his manner, his whole bearing,
quiet, dignified, easy. Why, he has quite English club
form! And where can he have got it? At any rate,
there will be some one to talk to on the way, and as
he is a master of Maori as well as English, he will
be invaluable as an interpreter."</p>

<p>Preliminaries are hateful things at best, but after
the usual hindrances a start was made tolerably early
in the day, and ere long our hero was inducted into
the peculiarities of forest wayfaring, as at that time
practised in New Zealand.</p>

<p>He had scorned the idea of performing any part of
it by sea or coach, having heard that all the pioneers,
aristocratic or otherwise, had been noted for their
pedestrian prowess.</p>

<p>So, with Warwick leading the way with the packhorse,
and he himself doughtily surmounting rock or

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

log, or thrusting between brambles and climbers, he
realized that he was at length actively engaged in
the adventurous experiences he had come so far to seek.</p>

<p>They did not always keep to the rude highways,
or accepted tracks of ordinary travellers; Warwick
seemed, without bestowing thought or care upon the
matter, to journey upon a line of his own. It invariably
turned out to be the correct one, as it cut off
angles and shortened the distances, always striking
points on the main trail which he had previously
described. All the available stopping-places on the
road were thoroughly well known to him, and between
the more desirable inns and accommodation houses,
at all of which Warwick was evidently the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bienvenu</i>,
and the historical localities near which Massinger was
prone to linger, no great progress was made. However,
time being no object, they wandered along in a
leisurely and satisfactory way, Massinger congratulating
himself again and again on his good fortune
in having secured such a guide and companion.</p>

<p>At Mercer, on their third day out, Mr. Massinger
was gladdened with his first sight of the Waikato,
that noble river around which so many legends have
been woven, on whose banks so much blood has
been shed, on whose broad bosom the whale-boat
has succeeded the canoe, the steamer the whale-boat.
His spirits rose to enthusiasm as they traversed
the country between the river and the lakes of Waikare
and Rangarui. While at Taupiri, he marked the
groves&mdash;actual groves, as he exclaimed&mdash;of peach
and cherry trees planted by the missionaries in past
days. Then leaving the river, they entered on the great
Waikato plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"All this is very pleasant," he said one morning;
"though, but for the absence of red-tiled farmhouses
and smock-wearing yokels, I might as well be back
in Herefordshire. What I am dying to see, is a
decent-sized village&mdash;<i>kainga</i>, don't you call it?&mdash;where
I may see the noble Maori with his <i>meremere</i>,
his <i>pah</i>, and his <i>wharepuni</i>, in all his pristine glory
unsullied by pakeha companionship."</p>

<p>"I think I can manage that for you," replied
Warwick, with an amused smile, "between here and
Oxford."</p>

<p>"What, more England?" said Massinger. "Why
not Clapham and Paddington at once?"</p>

<p>"Well, you must bear with Lichfield," continued
Warwick. "We can turn off there and make for
Taupo. Before we get there, I can promise you one
real Maori settlement, as well as another rather more
important, at Taupo on the lake."</p>

<p>"And a chief?" queried the wayfarer. "I must
have chiefs. A real Rangatira."</p>

<p>"I believe Waka Nene, warrior, high chief, and
ally of England, is on a visit at the first one we come
to," said the guide, "and he should satisfy your taste
for Maori life."</p>

<p>Their pathway was narrow, chiefly bordered by
high ferns, various kinds of low-growing bushes, and
when the forest was reached, occasionally blocked
by fallen timber, which necessitated a considerable
detour, not always accomplished without difficulty,
and obstacles which seemed to multiply the fatigues
of the journey. Still, the wondrous beauty of the
primeval forest had fully repaid him for all difficulties
which nature placed in their way. Hundreds

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>

of feet overhead, almost hiding the rays of the
autumnal sun, and causing Massinger to throw back
his head to gaze at their lofty coronets of foliage,
rose the royal ranks of the Kauri, the Totara, the
Rimu, and the Kahikatea. Unlike the less o'er-shadowed
forests in Australia described in his premigratory
course of reading, there was but little
herbage to be seen between the giants of that unconquered
woodland. Ferns, trailers, thorn bushes,
often breast-high, more or less aggressive, climbers
and parasites, filled up all space beneath the columnar
trunks which stretched so far and wide.</p>

<p>It could easily be imagined how great an advantage
the native warrior, but little encumbered with
clothes, and active as the panther, had over the
heavily armed, heavily clothed soldier of the regular
forces. A fair, though not accurate shot at short
range, practically almost invisible, the native is
trained to take advantage of every description of
covert. What chance, then, Massinger thought, would
British regulars have against the guerilla tactics of
this stubborn, fearless, yet crafty race?</p>

<p>As happened to many a gallant British soldier in
the American revolutionary war, it might be a brave
man's lot to be shot by a boy of fourteen, safely bestowed
behind a fallen tree, or protected by a thicket
whence he could empty his rifle at the fully exposed
ranks of the pakeha. Though active, and fond of
strong exercise of all kinds, Massinger was by no
means sorry when his guide halted by the side of
a gurgling stream, and intimated that they would
here halt for refreshment. Rows of that magnificent
fern, <i>Dicksonia</i>, fully thirty feet in height, towered

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>

over the banks of the rushing streamlet; a level
patch of verdure near the bank provided a tempting
lounge, as well as a table on which to arrange their
humble meal. There reclining, the wayfarer from
a far land reflected approvingly on the first stages
of a journey which already promised a world of novel
and mysterious experiences. And now a new experience
awaited him.</p>

<p>Rested and refreshed, they moved on till towards
evening, when Warwick, after following the path
which led to the brow of a steep hill, stopped and
invited his companion to look around. Far in the
distance loomed the curved shoulder of a snow-crowned
mountain. The ocean again rose to view.
A winding river threaded the fields and pastures
of a broad meadow. Tiny columns of smoke ascended
from a collection of reed-constructed cabins.
And with a distinct relaxation of feature, the guide
pronounced the word <i>Kainga</i>&mdash;"Here is our stage for
the night."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a native village, or more strictly
speaking, a "township." For there were, besides a
considerable population, distinctive and representative
features which in ancient Britain would have
entitled it to the appellation of a <em>castrum</em>&mdash;witness
Doncaster, Colchester, Winchester, and the like.</p>

<p>Above the alluvial flat, on the scarped and
terraced hill, rose the <i>pah</i>, or fortress proper&mdash;now
in good working, that is, warlike order.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a castle!" exclaimed Massinger. "I
had no idea that the natives did things in this style.
I doubt whether the ancient Britons had one like this
to check the Roman advance. Certainly they had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

no rifle-pits. Fancy climbing up these precipices
to find a double line of desperate warriors at the
top!"</p>

<p>"All the same, it was taken once, after a fairly
long siege; and a fine, bloodthirsty affair it was, by
all accounts," said Warwick. "But the garrison had
been weakened."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"The water gave out; food was short also. That
they could have borne, but they had nothing to drink
for days before they gave in."</p>

<p>"This great fortress, for such it was" (wrote an
eye-witness), "was constructed by this singular people
with due attention to the canons of strategic fortification.
It stood on a peak two thousand feet high, on
the summit of a tortuous forest range, girt on each
side by precipitous gorges and rugged intervening
eminences.</p>

<p>"Triple lines of palisading guarded the front, while
the crest of the ridge was narrowed in wedge-like
form to the rear of the <i>pah</i>. The outer parapet,
seven feet high, extended on each side to the edge
of the range, but was formed with angles near its
junction with the cliff, in order to cover completely
an attacking party. The inner parapet, more than
twelve feet high, was guarded by sandbag loopholes
to enable the garrison to fire in safety. Covered
ways, from parapet to parapet, and pit to pit, protected
the garrison in their movements."</p>

<p>This was one of the sights which he had "come
out into the wilderness for to see"&mdash;specially and in
spite of its being a tolerably large and important
<i>hapu</i>, or section of the great Ngatiawa tribe, with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>

whom relations were certainly strained. His adventurous
soul was stirred within him, as he marked the
position of the <i>wharepuni</i>, or council-hall, imposing
in size and ornamentation, elaborate though rude;
the clustering <i>whares</i> or wigwams, each containing
the family unit complete; with men, women, and
children, dogs and ponies, straying about in careless
intermixture; the warriors of the tribe holding
aloof in haughty independence, the "grave and reverend
seigneurs" sitting in a circle, indulging in converse&mdash;doubtless
as to matters of state. It became increasingly
apparent to his mind that the affairs of such a
race deserved all the consideration which the most experienced,
just, and intelligent legislators could bestow.</p>

<p>As they approached, the stranger could observe that
a certain degree of excitement had already commenced
to make itself visible. The men who had
been sitting arose, and those who were already standing,
relinquished their attitudes of dignified ease for
those of watchful attention, not unmingled with suspicion.
The women left their work or play (for
among the younger ones several games of skill or
address were evidently in progress) and joined the
expectant crowd.</p>

<p>Male and female, young and old, there could hardly
have been less than three hundred people gathered
together on the comparatively small plateau. From
their point of view it had exceptional advantages, and
had doubtless been selected with foresight and judgment.
Overlooking the river, winding through a
fertile meadow, which showed by its careful and
intense cultivation how the principal food-supply of
the tribe was furnished, it was protected by the almost

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>

perpendicular river-bank, of great height, from sudden
assault. An undulating stretch of open or timbered
country filled in the foreground, while in the dim distance
rose the giant form of Tongariro, cloud-capped,
menacing, in dread majesty and sublimity, and but
a few miles to the eastward, calm in the fading light,
lay the placid waters of a lake. Strangely beautiful
as was the whole landscape, wanting no element
which in other lands excites wonder or arouses
admiration, there was yet a feeling of undefined doubt,
amounting to suspicion of evil, as his eye roved over
the unfamiliar scene. This was confirmed, even deepened,
as a geyser between them and the lake suddenly
shot to a height of fifty or sixty feet in the air, while a
hitherto unsuspected fumarole sent its smoke-columns
towards the firmament. Yet not a head was turned,
not a movement made by the group, "native and to
the manner born." Geysers and fumaroles were part
of their daily life, it would appear.</p>

<p>"There may be differences of opinion as to the
advantages of their proximity," thought the white
stranger, as he scanned the grand and majestic
features of the wide landscape before him, "but none
can deny their sublimity." He could scarce refrain
from exclaiming aloud&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"Lives there the man with soul so dead,</span>
      <span class="i1">Who never to himself hath said," etc.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If he had carried out the unspoken thought he would
have raised himself in the estimation of his newly
found acquaintances, as no nation has had a higher
appreciation of elocutionary effort; and a free translation
by his guide would have doubtless confirmed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>

the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i>. As it was, however, the few
sentences uttered by his companion, in which, among
others, he recognized the words Pakeha, Rangatira,
and Mata Kawana, were sufficiently satisfactory. This
was, of course, after the formal greeting of "<i>Haere
mai!</i>" had been pronounced by the elders and principal
personages of the assembly, as well as by all the
women, and the rank and file.</p>

<p>A venerable and imposing-looking personage,
apparently of great age, approached to greet the
strangers, and, after exchanging a few sentences of
an interrogatory nature, pointed the way to an unoccupied
<i>whare</i> of larger dimensions than the
others. In this, Mr. Massinger was told, through the
interpreter, to place his possessions, and to consider
himself at home for the present. An adjoining tenement
was indicated, in a less formal way, as provided
for his companion, the difference of their positions
being accurately understood. Indeed, the socialists
of the day would be rather scandalized at the gulf
which separates the Maori aristocrat, or <i>rangatira</i>,
from the "common people" (if one may use such an
expression) of the tribe.</p>

<p>The <i>rangatira</i> was, indeed, a personage of no
ordinary distinction. Served from his childhood by
his "inferiors," in the most true and literal sense of
the word; waited upon with deference, mingled with
apprehension, by the women, the slaves and the rank
and file of the tribal section, or <i>hapu</i>, to which he
was born, no wonder that he grew up with the traditional
qualities imputed to the mediæval aristocrat.</p>

<p>He was the robber-baron of the Rhine; he
was the untrammelled seigneur of the time of Louis

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>

Quatorze; he was the piratical Viking of the Norse
legends.</p>

<p>He raided his weaker neighbours; he descended
upon defenceless coast settlements; he organized
carefully thought-out plans of invasion, alliance, or
reprisal. He was comprehensively merciless in war,
slaying and enslaving at will. But he possessed, by
the strongest contemporary evidence, the corresponding
virtues. He was brave to recklessness, chivalrous to
a degree unknown in modern warfare, sending notice
of attack, in ordinary cases, before the commencement
of hostilities; and, in well-authenticated instances, even
forwarding ammunition to the enemy who had run
short of powder, invariably choosing death before dishonour.
And he was religious after his own fashion,
recognizing superior as well as inferior deities and
supernatural personages, whom it was important to
honour and conciliate. He was at all times ready to
die for his principles, or in vindication of his dignity
and hereditary position.</p>

<p>Roland Massinger, when he found himself in full
possession of the <i>whare</i>, which had been floored with
clean fern, and even adorned with several bunches of
the beautiful crimson rata and pohutukawa blossoms,
began to revolve the strange chain of circumstances
which had led to his finding himself the honoured
guest of this sub-section of a more or less ferocious
tribe. Nothing imaginable could be more romantic;
at the same time, the situation was, at the best, only
comparatively satisfactory. The smouldering blood-feud
between the races, already dangerously fanned
by the mistaken action already referred to, might
blaze up at any moment. Then, the war-spirit once

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

aroused, and the boding scream of the <i>Hokioi</i> thrilling
all hearts, the position of an isolated European would
be doubtful, if not desperate.</p>

<p>Of the risks and chances thus involved, however,
our adventurer made but little account. He had not
come so far to abstain from exploration of this
wonderful country. It was not worse than Africa,
whence many an Englishman had returned rich and
distinguished. Whatever happened, he was embarked
in the enterprise; would go through with it at all
hazards.</p>

<p>With the addition of a small contribution from his
store of provisions to the <i>kumera</i>, pork and potatoes,
together with a great dish of <i>peppis</i>, or cockles,
supplied in clean flat baskets, he made a satisfactory
meal, concluding, of course, with a pannikin of tea.
He had arranged his rug and blankets at one side of
his rude chamber, and, being reasonably tired with
the day's journey, looked forward to a night's rest of
a superior description.</p>

<p>He walked a few steps from the door, and, lighting
his pipe, gazed upon the scene before him. The moon,
nearly full, lighted up the river, the meadow, the distant
mountain, the dark-hued forest. No civilized habitation
was visible. No sound broke the stillness of the night,
save the murmuring voices of the dwellers in this
strange settlement of primitive humanity. Habitudes
common to all societies, rude or civilized, were not
wanting. Women talked and laughed, children
prattled or lamented, as the case might be. There
was the narrator of events, the wandering minstrel,
the troubadour or "jongleur" of this later Arcadia,
with his circle of interested listeners. The boys and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>

girls played at games, or walked in friendly converse,
much as those of their age do in all countries. The
men were grave or gay, earnest or indifferent, as elsewhere.
Occasionally he caught the word <i>pakeha</i>
strongly accented, from which he gathered that his
appearance and movements had aroused curiosity,
perhaps suspicion.</p>

<p>After a while he observed a small party or group
of mixed sexes, which, breaking up, moved in the
direction of his abode. As they came closer, he
observed the guide walking among them. Coming to
the front, as he advanced to meet them, he inquired
of him what it meant.</p>

<p>"They want you to go tomorrow and see the
famous lakes and terraces. I told them you were in
a hurry, and must go back to the Governor at Auckland."
Upon this, the leaders of the party, among
whom were several young girls, raised a cry of dissent,
making angry gestures and sportively threatening the
guide, while they pointed towards the east, intimating
that the proposed expedition was <i>kapai</i> ("very good").</p>

<p>By the time the explanation had reached that stage,
Roland found himself encircled by these dusky
maidens, who, with flashing eyes, animated gestures,
and caressing tones, sought to make the <i>pakeha
rangatira</i> understand that the arrangement would be
much to his advantage.</p>

<p>The guide spoke to them in the native tongue,
extolling the importance and wealth of his patron,
and rather deprecating the expedition, as inconsistent
with the responsible duties which were his peculiar
province. However, such was the persistency with
which they urged their argument, that, after asking

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>

for a literal translation of the several inducements
held out, Roland pretended to waver.</p>

<p>"How long will it take," he inquired of his guide,
"to go and return?"</p>

<p>"Not more than two or three weeks," he returned
answer.</p>

<p>"And are the natives much the same as these?"</p>

<p>"No great difference, except that they are more
expert in getting money out of travellers."</p>

<p>"Will any of these young people go with us?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, if you ask them, and give them a small
keepsake, or something in the way of pay, for their
services."</p>

<p>"Then, I think I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>How the pakeha was about to end this speech
may never be accurately known, for at that moment
a loud cry of "Erena, Erena!" arose from the rear,
and a girl, differing in several important respects from
the young women around him, moved quietly through
the crowd and stood among the foremost speakers.</p>

<p>Roland at once recognized in the new-comer a
personality altogether different from any which he
had previously encountered in New Zealand. It was
not alone that she was fairer than her dusky sisters;
such complexions had he seen before, due to the
intermixture of the races, by no means uncommon in
the coast towns. Many of the young people of that
blood were distinctly handsome in face and striking
in figure. But there was something regal and statuesque
in the bearing of this damsel which he had
scarcely realized as of possibility in a Maori tribe.</p>

<p>Her dress consisted of a more ornate and elaborate
upper garment than the ordinary flax mat, or <i>puriri</i>,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>

worn by the other women of the tribe. Later on,
Massinger learned to know it as a <i>kaitaka</i>, or shawl,
made of the finest flax, laboriously prepared, till it
almost resembled silk in texture and appearance; a
portion of it was dyed black, and worked in small
diamond-shaped patterns, surmounted by long white
fringes.</p>

<p>It might almost have been woven in a loom, such
was the precision with which the fine twisted flax
threads crossed each other at intervals. The making
of such a garment, chiefly worn by women of rank or
distinction, required both skill and patience; a whole
winter was not considered an unreasonable time to
devote to its manufacture. Gracefully draped over
one rounded shoulder, it fell in folds over a striped
woollen undergarment reaching below the knees, permitting
the free, graceful, and unstudied movements
so characteristic of the untrammelled races of the
earth.</p>

<p>As this girl walked slowly forward, the Englishman
thought she might have stood for a sculptor's model
of a woodland nymph, as yet unconscious of the
admiring glances of Ph&#630;bus Apollo.</p>

<p>"Who is this young woman?" said Roland to the
guide. "What is her name, and how does she come
to be with the natives?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Erena Mannering," said he. "She
belongs to the tribe, though she is a half-caste. Her
father was a sea-captain, and her mother a chief's
daughter. I have told her about you, and she wishes
to speak."</p>

<p>"But I cannot talk Maori. You will have to
interpret what she says and what I say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The guide smiled. "She can speak English as
well as we can. She was educated at a college in
Wanganui, endowed for the teaching of Maoris and
half-castes."</p>

<p>Thus emboldened, Roland advanced, and begged
to be favoured with her advice as to his making the
journey to Rotomahana.</p>

<p>"I hear," he said, "that there are difficulties in
the way. My good friend Warwick thinks that if the
country is not in a disturbed state now, it soon may
be, in which case there might be risks. They tell me,
however, that it is a charming place, and well worth
a trial."</p>

<p>"It is the most beautiful place I ever saw or
dreamed of," answered the strange maiden, in a low
rich voice, and with perfect intonation. "For the
danger, I cannot speak. There may be, if war breaks
out; but Maoris do not kill white strangers unless they
have a motive. Do you care very much to go?"</p>

<p>The expedition was now, in Roland's chivalrous
mind, rapidly assuming the form of an adventure.
War, danger, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle sauvage</i>! He thought of
"The Burial of Atala" which he had seen in the
gallery of the Louvre, and answered with decision&mdash;</p>

<p>"Always with your permission, I have made up
my mind to see Rotomahana or die."</p>

<p>The girl smiled, as she looked fixedly at the white
stranger with half-compassionate eyes.</p>

<p>"You are like all your countrymen. Only say
there is a chance of being killed, and you cannot stop
them. I will speak to the chief. He may write you
a pass, and then none can harm you."</p>

<p>Whereupon she glided forward, and, threading

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>

the group, stood before the chief, with whom she
conversed earnestly for some minutes, after which she
reappeared.</p>

<p>"The chief says that you must go at your own
peril. There might be danger if war is declared. But
he does not think you will be interfered with. He
will send people with you."</p>

<p>"Wonders will never cease," thought Roland.
"Fancy this majestic chief writing a note, 'Please
don't eat the bearer till I come,' or something to that
effect!" But he only said that he was astonished at
his kindness, and would gratefully accept his written
passport.</p>

<p>"I dare say you are surprised at a Maori chief
writing at all; but Waka Nene is a baptized Christian.
He was converted by one of the early missionaries,
and taught to read and write. He has been a firm
friend of the English ever since. He fought for them
in Honii Heke's war, and will fight for them in this
one, if your people are foolish enough to bring it on."</p>

<p>"My eyes are being opened; by-and-by I shall
be enlightened as to Maori matters. At present I
know little. But my friends in England will never
believe me if I tell them of a Maori chief writing
notes, and a Maori young lady talking excellent
English."</p>

<p>"I am not a young lady&mdash;I am only a half-caste
Maori girl; but I can help your people now and then.
Is there anything else that I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"There is one thing more which would add so
much to my pleasure in this journey," said Roland,
emboldened by the strange, unreal aspect of all things&mdash;the
flowing river, murmuring in the stillness of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

night; the savage people in groups, lying or standing
around; the dramatic scene with this half-wild maiden,
with flashing eyes and mobile face, a figure like the
huntress Diana, and a rich low-toned voice that was
like the murmur of a love-song. "There is one
thing which would make the journey perfect."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the damsel, looking him
full in the face with the clear unabashed eyes of
youth and innocence.</p>

<p>"That you would accompany us."</p>

<p>He felt, as he uttered the words, that he had
presumed too far on such a slight acquaintance, and
that she might resent the proposal.</p>

<p>Much to his relief, however, she smiled like a
pleased child, and looking at him with much earnestness,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would you really like me to go?"</p>

<p>"Like you to go! Why, I should be charmed.
Think of the advantage to me of a companion familiar
with all the points of the landscape, as well as every
legend and historic locality. But it is too great a
favour to ask."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes glowed, as with animated countenance
Roland proceeded to detail the amazing benefits
of this arrangement. But, true to her sex, she appeared
to hesitate, and finally said she must consult the chief;
if he offered no objection, they would start early on
the following morning.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more promising or more in
accordance with Roland's feelings. His guide, who
had contented himself with putting in a word or two
now and then, had a short conversation in Maori with
the new-found goddess. Then bidding him good-night,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>

she passed on with swift steps towards the group of
elders, where the chief still stood. There she apparently
entered upon the affair of the expedition, for question
and answer were quickly interchanged, and the earnest
tones of the speakers&mdash;several of the surrounding
elders having joined in&mdash;showed that the question was
being fully debated. Lastly, at a few sentences uttered
by the youngest man of the party, she laughingly
shook her hand threateningly at him, and ran lightly
back to the part of the <i>kainga</i> from which she had
first emerged.</p>

<p>"It is all right," said Warwick; "the chief has
consented. Erena will go with us tomorrow. She
is better than any man on a journey, and knows
every step of the way. We had better make an early
start."</p>

<p>This Mr. Massinger had every inclination to do;
so, after smoking a couple of pipes in front of their
temporary castle, producing tobacco, and distributing
largesse of the same in free fashion, which conduced
to his instant popularity, he lay down in his <i>whare</i>
enveloped in rugs and coverings, where the rippling
river lulled him into sleep so sound that the chatter
of the village gossips, and even the baying of the
dogs, which occasionally broke into chorus, had no
power to disturb it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dawn light awoke Massinger, who, since his
arrival in New Zealand, had cultivated the virtuous
habit of early rising, considering it to be one of the
necessary attributes of a hardy colonist. Like others
who have been educated by circumstances to the
practice, he found so many advantages accruing from
it, that he resolved to continue it. Hence, though a
sufficient sleeper in the early watches of the night, he
began to be automatically awakened at daybreak.</p>

<p>A glance around revealed the unfamiliar circumstances
of his environment. Of the various groups
which had constituted the village community on the
previous night, by far the greater number were silent,
or slumbering in the <i>whares</i>. An occasional figure
raising itself from the recumbent position showed that
he was not the only wakeful one in the <i>kainga</i>.
Half-forgotten tales of Indian warfare, recurred to
his memory, where the hero, desiring to escape from
captivity, looks upon much the same scene as that
which lay before him. He could not but feel that he
and Warwick were entirely at the mercy of the
warriors who composed the greater part of the <i>hapu</i>
there assembled. The turn of a straw, in the electrical

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>

condition of the political atmosphere, might lead to
bloodshed, involving a declaration of war. The first
reverse would doubtless throw the Maori people into
such a state of wrath and exasperation, that, even
against the policy of their chiefs, irresponsible members
of the tribe might be tempted to sacrifice isolated
parties of the invading race.</p>

<p>The prospect of a journey by unknown paths through
a trackless wilderness, with however fair a goal, did
not look so alluring as when associated overnight with
the witchery of Erena Mannering's eyes and wonderfully
expressive countenance, which hardly needed the
translation of her thoughts into words.</p>

<p>However, the die was cast. He had given his
sanction to the affair; and Roland Massinger was
not the man under such circumstances to go back an
inch from his word. Before dressing for the day, he
took advantage of the proximity of the river for a
bath, a preliminary step which, when circumstances
permitted, he never omitted. While descending the
slope which led to the river bank, he was joined by
Warwick, who came leaping along the steep descent
like a mountain deer. Arrayed in a pyjama suit
only, which indicated the symmetry of his magnificent
figure, his employer could not avoid admiration at his
grand and striking presence. Taller by several inches
than himself, his muscular development was exceptionally
fine, while his activity, as evidenced by the constancy
of his pace, and the ease with which he mounted
and descended the most precipitous hills, clearing the
smaller running streams with hardly an apparent
effort, was truly abnormal.</p>

<p>A sure and deadly shot, he made excellent practice

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>

with the navy revolver which he carried in his belt.
So that, in addition to his general knowledge of the
people and the country, Massinger rightly judged that
he might have searched far before finding so perfect
a pathfinder; at the same time, a comrade of courage
and resource, on whom he might rely in the hour
of need.</p>

<p>By the time they had fully refreshed themselves
in the rushing tide of the Huka, they discovered that
a considerable body of spectators had gathered on
the higher terrace which commanded the spot which
they had chosen for their ablutions. As they passed
through the crowd now collected between them and
their <i>whares</i>, from time to time such words were heard
as, "<i>Kapai te Pakeha, kapai!</i>" "<i>Kapai te Rangatira!</i>"
but all was in the nature of compliment to the
travellers, and more particularly the pakeha, or white
stranger. Warwick they appeared to regard as akin
to them, and therefore not possessing the charm of
mystery. Food was then brought, more than sufficient
in quantity, and by no means to be despised by men
whose appetite had been sharpened by a toilsome
day's journey and the eager air of this antarctic
wilderness.</p>

<p>The traveller had bread, and even butter, in his
packs. With these aids, and, of course, quart-pot tea,
the repast, if wanting in delicacy, was yet ample and
satisfactory. After its completion, and the lighting
of the after-breakfast pipe, he felt fully equal to the
inauguration of the expedition, and awaited somewhat
impatiently the appearance of the tutelar divinity.</p>

<p>"How about the maiden fair? Do you think she
has changed her mind, Warwick?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another woman might, but not Erena," said the
guide, with an air of conviction. "Before long she
will come round the corner of that hill. I dare say
she'll have some of her people with her. She's
an aristocrat in her way."</p>

<p>"I should think she was," said the other, with an
air of entire conviction. "She should be a most
interesting study. Are there many more of the
intellectual daughter of the soil sort, in these woods
and forests? She is like Rosalind in the forest of
Arden, but there does not appear to be an Orlando
so far. I shall be anxious to see the other damsels."</p>

<p>"There will be two, if not three, with her today.
One of her male cousins is a fellow whose company
I'd rather not have now, or at any time; said to be
an admirer of hers, which makes him more objectionable
still. Here they come, however, with Erena
marching ahead like a queen! Three girls, and a
young fellow who's been educated at sea, with this
sulky brute Ngarara&mdash;confound <em>him</em> very particularly!&mdash;bringing
up the rear."</p>

<p>As Warwick had foretold, the little party came
round the corner of the mount and made straight for
the centre of the village. By this time the grey
mare had been brought up and saddled. Upon her
the various packs were placed, to the great interest
and excitement of the youth of the community, who
gathered round and commented freely upon the
<em>personnel</em> and otherwise of the expedition. Discovering
by experience that, with some additions, the mare
was sufficiently weighted, and that riding in such a
country was more trouble than it was worth, her
owner elected to travel on foot, like the rest of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>

party. This would leave him more at liberty to
examine the botanical and geological features of the
strange region upon which they were entering. The
position, too, would be more dignified than riding at
a foot pace, pushing his way through entangling
thickets. Besides all this, he would, in right of his
position as head and paymaster of the expedition, be
entitled to take his place alongside of the most
interesting personage. Thus, in the daily march, he
would enjoy the original converse of an unspoiled
daughter of Eve, fresh from Nature's bosom, unhackneyed
by the artifices and conventional deceits
of the children of the world.</p>

<p>He walked forward and greeted the forest maiden,
who smiled frankly and held out her hand, which he
took with becoming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empressement</i>. In one comprehensive
glance at her, before he relinquished it, he
noted the details of her dress and equipment. Her
figure, statuesque in every curve and line as the
Venus of Milo, was scarcely concealed by the robe
which, thrown across the chest and upper arm,
revealed in part the outline of her classic bust, while
affording full play to every motion of the arms and
hands. A species of kirtle, coming below the knee,
left her lower limbs free and unconfined. Her feet
were bare, the smallness of which, as well as the
delicate moulding of the limbs, betrayed her British
ancestry.</p>

<p>Perfectly attired for travel through the steep
ascents, the treacherous morasses and dense woodland
of her native land, as with sparkling eyes and
gladsome expression she walked forth at the head of
the little party, Massinger thought he had never

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

before seen a more perfect presentment of the
nymph of the legends of Hellas.</p>

<p>"We must say good-bye to the chief," she said;
"it is <i>tika</i>&mdash;due and proper respect. Besides, if we
leave without the paper he promised me we may
have trouble."</p>

<p>They accordingly marched up to the chief's abode,
upon which the venerable warrior walked forward to
meet them. He spoke a few words to Warwick, who
replied in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"Is the pakeha's heart strong to journey to the
hot lakes and the burning earth, and does he not
fear the warriors of Te Heu Heu who will be in his
path?"</p>

<p>"The pakeha is a <i>toa</i>," replied the guide. "He
fears no man. With his <i>tuparra</i> he can shoot men
as far as he can see them, and he has a pocket-gun,
which carries six men's lives, in his belt. So have I."</p>

<p>"No doubt the pakeha will fight," said the chief,
"but bullets come from the bush sometimes. The
hearts of my people are not sore, and I pray that
peace may be kept. Here is the paper which I
promised to the white rangatira. It will show Te
Heu Heu and his people that he is not a man to be
treated like a runaway sailor; and if they have
doubts, Erena must speak to them. Her voice is
like the flute of Tutekane, and they cannot but
listen."</p>

<p>So the expedition departed on its way, Roland
and Erena walking ahead. One of the younger
Maoris, at a word from Warwick, took the bridle of
the grey, and followed in the rear; while the others
of the party, including the surly Ngarara, who regarded

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>

Roland with a fixed and sinister gaze, took up the
trail and plunged into the forest.</p>

<p>Their path led for some miles along the course of
a narrow but swift and deep rivulet, until at length
it became necessary to cross it at a gravelly ford.
Then he saw the advantage which Erena possessed
in being without shoes and stockings. She calmly
waded in without damage to her attire, and tripped
up the opposite bank. While Massinger was speculating
as to whether he should unlace his boots, and
so save the necessity of going in wet ones for the
remainder of the day, Warwick made a sign to one
of the men, who without further ado "made a back,"
as in schoolboy days, taking him up thereon and
across the stream, as if he had been one in good
earnest. This feat accomplished, the party proceeded
as before, through the primeval forest. It
began now to be apparent that the difficulties of
the way were likely to increase rather than to
diminish.</p>

<p>The flax swamps appeared to become deeper and
more treacherous, the hills to be higher, the path
less easy to distinguish, the thickets more dense,
and the thorn bushes more clinging and obstructive.
Through all these obstacles and hindrances the Maori
maiden seemed to glide like a disembodied spirit,
keeping up a pace the while which taxed Massinger's
powers more shrewdly than he would have believed
possible. He was a good pedestrian, proud of his
speed and stamina, but he had to confess to himself
that this damsel and her attendants made the pace
considerably better than he would have believed
possible through such a country. Uphill or down

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

made no difference, apparently, to them. Warwick
marched in the rear, and kept an eye on the man
who was leading the packhorse, any accident to
which, in flood or marsh, would have made a serious
difference in the comfort of the party.</p>

<p>Massinger was not, therefore, displeased when, after
scaling a higher hill than they had as yet encountered,
Erena pointed to a wide expanse of champaign&mdash;more
extensive, indeed, than he was beginning to think he
was likely to see again&mdash;and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here we stop for an hour. I dare say you will
like a rest."</p>

<p>He did not care to acknowledge that he had been
nearly outpaced by this young woman and her wildwood
friends, but looking at her before he answered,
he noticed a mirthful twinkle in her dark eyes, which
convinced him that she comprehended fully the
humour of the situation.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been trying whether this
pakeha can walk," he said, as she smiled archly. "Your
country is not easy, and I am scarcely in training. But
in a few days I will match myself against any of your
people to run, jump, or walk for a wager."</p>

<p>"You must not do that with these natives," said
she, gravely. "You would lose your <i>mana</i>, as we
say, if you, a <i>rangatira</i> of the pakehas, engaged in
contests of sport with the common people. However,
some day you may have a chance of trying your speed
against them. Warwick will tell you the same thing."</p>

<p>"Between your instructions and his, I shall soon
know everything that is necessary for my good."</p>

<p>"Oh! he is very clever, and a <i>toa</i> as well&mdash;that
is, a known athlete or warrior. There has been no

fighting since Heki's war in 1845, or he would have
distinguished himself in that way, I feel sure."</p>

<p>"And now, tell me, do <em>you</em> think there is any
danger of war breaking out, as some people think?"</p>

<p>"There <em>will</em> be war," replied the girl, fixing her
eyes upon him with a sad and boding expression, "if
the Governor takes the Waitara block by force. The
chief thinks so too. He has remonstrated against it,
though he will fight for your Queen to the death, and
lead his tribe, the great tribe of the Ngapuhi, against
her enemies."</p>

<p>"It is a pity it cannot be avoided; but, after all,
there are worse things than war."</p>

<p>"If there are, I do not know them," said this
Egeria of the South. "I have not seen a Maori war,
but if you had heard the things I have heard you
would never speak lightly of one of the most awful
things in the world."</p>

<p>"Then I hope there will <em>not</em> be war," said Massinger,
with a smile. "Personally, I suppose the sooner I get
over to Rotorua and back to Auckland the better it
will be. But whatever happens, I shall always thank
the fates that sent me on this particular journey."</p>

<p>"Then you are pleased, even now," she said. "Oh,
I am so glad!" and coming nearer to him, she took
both his hands in hers, and, with a gesture of childish
simplicity, pressed them warmly, gazing into his face
with a look of frank delight, as might a sister thanking
a brother for a birthday gift.</p>

<p>He had never met this type of womanhood before,
and might have well been pardoned if he had misunderstood
the feelings which appeared to actuate
this woodland sylph. But possessing, as he did, a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

sympathetic insight into the higher nature of women,
he judged correctly that she was merely pleased with
his approval of her presence and companionship.</p>

<p>As she withdrew her hands in a natural and instinctive
fashion, while the blush which mantled under
her clear brown skin showed that she felt herself to
have overpassed the conventional line of courtesy, he
half turned towards their attendants, who in Indian
file were following up their footsteps. The Maori
Ngarara was foremost on the trail, and must have
noticed their attitude. For one brief moment his
countenance wore the impress of all the darker passions,
then relapsed into its usual expression of sullen dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"We must descend now," said she, after their meal
was ended. "I will promise not to go so fast for a
while; you will find the evening walk quite a saunter
after this morning."</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask, did you make the pace so
good then?"</p>

<p>"I had a reason, a good one," she replied; "I did
not hear about it till we were half way, or I should
most certainly never have come this route at all. Did
you observe a Maori woman come up for a few minutes,
speak to Warwick, and go away?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought she might have some connection
with the bearers. I hardly knew whether she stayed
with them or disappeared. Did she bring a message?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a most important one, too. That's why
I pushed on at such a rate. If we had been nearer
home, I should have returned; but the retreat would
have been more dangerous than an advance."</p>

<p>"How can that be?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"That woman ran twenty miles to warn me that
Taratoa was out with a <i>taua</i>&mdash;a war expedition.
She said the natives believed that the war was all but
declared. Now, as Warwick will tell you, this Taratoa
is one of the most turbulent and bloodthirsty chiefs of
his ruthless tribe; and that is saying a good deal.
He might&mdash;I don't say that he would, but it is quite
possible&mdash;think it a fine chance of increasing his <i>mana</i>
by killing the first pakeha, which would mean the
<i>mataika</i> in the war&mdash;a most coveted distinction."</p>

<p>"What a ruffian! But 'dans la guerre c'est la
guerre.' Pardon me for quoting the French proverb."</p>

<p>"Mais, monsieur, je le comprend parfaitement,"
she returned for answer, with a mock obeisance. "You
must remember that there are here French as well as
English colonists. And besides, I spent a year at
Akaroa long ago, which, as all the world knows&mdash;the
New Zealand world, I mean&mdash;was at one time a
French settlement."</p>

<p>Massinger bowed with all the grace he could
muster, and apologized for thinking it impossible that
a New Zealand girl was conversant with French.
"You remind me," he said, "of the Admiral in 'Singleton
Fontenoy,' a naval novel of a later day than good
old Captain Marryat. He asks one of the middies,
when before Acre, if he spoke Turkish.</p>

<p>"'No, sir. Oh no! what made you think
so?'"</p>

<p>"'Well, you youngsters seem to have learned
everything nowadays. I thought you might know
that among other languages.'"</p>

<p>She laughed at this with the unreserved merriment
which characterized her when not serious or mournful,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

which, indeed, was the ordinary expression of her
features when in repose.</p>

<p>"You had better ask Warwick if <em>he</em> understands
Turkish. He knows most things. We must consult
with him as to what is best to be done, when we
camp. But I think we had better push on to the
Lakes, where we shall be in the territory of Te Heu
Heu. He will protect us."</p>

<p>So they fared on. Through flax swamps, where
the sodden soil was often midleg deep; anon through
rushing ice-cold streams, where there was difficulty in
keeping footing, even when in no great depth of
water; up the rugged sides of mountains, where the
narrow path lay between the century-old pines, knee-high
in bracken, and was occasionally obstructed by
the fallen mass of some patriarch of the forest, which
forbade direct progress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this wood-nymph and her attendants,
the latter of whom carried burdens of no mean weight,
tripped onward swiftly, as if the ordinary difficulties
of such a journey were hardly worthy of notice.
Erena sped along like a votary of the huntress Diana.
Few obstacles made any noticeable difference to her
pace, as she glided, at the head of the party, with
serene self-confidence&mdash;a marvel of grace, swiftness,
and endurance. Scarcely less was he stricken with
admiration at the courage and activity of the humbler
members of the party, particularly the women. They
carried their burdens over the difficulties of the road
with unflinching perseverance, following in Indian
file the footsteps of Warwick, who occasionally made
a detour, when he thought it advantageous.</p>

<p>"What astonishing infantry a race like this would

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

furnish!" thought Massinger. "Amid these forests,
reasonably drilled and armed, in a guerilla war they
could stand against the best troops in the world!
Sheltered by these ancient woods, the breast-high
bracken, these thickets impervious to all men but
themselves, what chance would disciplined troops
have against them? I hope to Heaven that we
may never have to war with them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'outrance</i>. A
succession of skirmishes would not matter so much,
but a prolonged war would be one of the most
expensive, and in some respects disastrous, on record."</p>

<p>He was recalled from these reflections by the
voice of the guide, who had fallen back, and stood
at some short distance, awaiting an opportunity to
speak.</p>

<p>"I have halted the party," he said, "for we have
no great distance to go, and may travel in a leisurely
manner. We shall soon have our first sight of
Taupo and commence to open out the hot lake
country, with all the wonders of which you have
heard."</p>

<p>"I am not sorry," said Massinger; "for though
nothing could be more to my taste than our present
form of journeying, yet I must confess to feeling
impatient to behold these marvels that are in every
one's mouth. I hope I shall not be disappointed."</p>

<p>"If so, you will be the first to confess it," said
Warwick. "I have seen them many times, but they
always fill me with fresh wonder and admiration.
Nothing, in some respects, is equal to them in the
world, I believe. 'See Rotomahana and die,' may
well be said."</p>

<p>"When I do see it, it will be well described.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>

Between Erena and yourself, I shall lose no part of
legend or tradition."</p>

<p>"She is far better at the legendary business than
I am," said Warwick. "She has such a wonderful
memory, and knows all the old tales and <i>waiatas</i>
by heart. I tell her she should write a <i>pukapuka</i>
about the place and the people. One is just as
strange as the other."</p>

<p>"I think I must," said the subject of their
conversation, who had now approached, after concluding
a colloquy with the women of the expedition.
"It seems hard that so many of these legends
should be lost. When I was a child, they used to
be sung and repeated at every camp fire. Now they
are on the way to be forgotten. My father was
always promising to make a collection of them, but
they strayed into 'By-and-by Street, which leads to
the House of Never.'"</p>

<p>Massinger smiled. "I know that street myself,
I must confess; but while I live in your country it
shall be <i>tapu</i>. The land of <i>Maui</i> is the place, and
this year of grace the appointed time, for my work
and adventure."</p>

<p>"And if there should be war?" said she, regarding
him with a searching look, not wholly, as he thought,
without a shade of doubt.</p>

<p>"All the more reason," he replied. "There is such
a scarcity of honest fighting nowadays, that it will be
a treat to face the real thing in one's own person."</p>

<p>For one instant an answering smile lit up her face
as she gazed at Massinger, who unconsciously drew
himself up and raised his head, as though fronting
an advancing column. She sighed, as she came

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

forward, and lightly touching his shoulder, looked
wistfully into his face. "You love war; it is in your
blood. So do my people; it is the breath of their
nostrils. My father, too, is a war-chief of the
Ngapuhi, and fought with them in the old wars.
But if you had ever seen Maoris in or after a battle,
you would think you were in a land of demons, not
men."</p>

<p>"A man can only die once. Your tribe, too, is on
our side, is it not? I can't think the hostile natives
will stand long before regular troops."</p>

<p>"Look at that bush," she said, pointing to a
dense thicket of <i>Koreao</i>, where all sorts of horizontal
climbers and clingers seemed struggling for the
mastery, and into which the van of the little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i>
had cast themselves, and gliding through, apparently
without effort, had in part disappeared. "How do
you think that a company of a regiment would
advance or retreat, with Ngarara" (that amiable
savage had just passed from view) "and a few
hundreds of his tribe firing at you from behind it?"</p>

<p>"To tell truth, I think Ngarara would rather
like it now, if he could get the chance; but I am a
fair snapshot, and would try for first pull. However,
we won't anticipate disagreeables. How far is
Rotomahana? I am dying to see the terraces."</p>

<p>"You pakehas are always gay," she said.
"Perhaps it is better to enjoy while we may. I
wish I could do so. But our <i>Tohunga</i> has been
prophesying, and his words have cast a shadow over
my mind, which I vainly try to resist."</p>

<p>"But surely your education has taught you to
despise superstitious fears?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"My reason does so; but the senses revolt,
strange as it may seem. I cannot get away from a
dread of impending evil. My father, who has Highland
blood in his veins, calls it the 'second sight.'"</p>

<p>"I have heard of it; and what did the seer
foretell? Is he known to be a true prophet?"
queried her companion.</p>

<p>"Wonderful as it may appear, he has been seldom
wrong. This time he predicts war&mdash;bloody and
doubtful. Our tribe, though sometimes defeated, is
to be victorious. He counsels them to keep a
straight path."</p>

<p>The next day's journey was over a different route.
The forest, with its over-arching tree-tops and deep
cool glades, lay behind them. They had entered
upon a region of barren and desolate sand wastes, of
which the neutral-tinted surface was varied by scarped
over-hanging bluffs. In these, a red-ochreous conglomerate
gave a weird and fantastic appearance to
the landscape.</p>

<p>Halting towards evening, where the winding road
by which they had been ascending appeared to decline
towards a wide valley, Erena silently directed Massinger's
attention to the far-stretching and varied
view, adding, "You are about to descend into the land
of wonders, and the kingdom of mysterious sights and
sounds, with heaven above. As to below, what shall
I say?"</p>

<p>He smiled as he answered, "It is only to look
around, to convince one's self that we are on the border
of a dread and unreal region. Look at that volcanic
cone, splashed with shades of red, emitting steam
from every point of its scarred sides and summit.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

And those snow-capped mountains, grand and awful
in their loneliness, gazing, as one would dream over
a ruined world, themselves awaiting only the final
conflagration."</p>

<p>"Very awful, terrible&mdash;infernal even, it seems to
me sometimes," said Erena. "I cannot help wondering
how long it will be before these imprisoned fires
burst through, and, in rending their way to upper air,
destroy the heedless people who live so cheerfully on
a mere crust. But we must get down into this valley
of Waiotapu, where we camp for the night. There
will be such a sight-seeing tomorrow in store for us,
that we shall hardly be able to move in the evening.
Blue lakes and green lakes will be the least of the
marvels. When I was a child, I used to think there
would be talking fish in them, like those of the 'Arabian
Nights,' which stood on their tails in the frying-pan."</p>

<p>"What a dear old book that is!" exclaimed he;
"how I used to delight in it as a boy! Now I think of
it, this region has a good deal of the Sindbad the Sailor
business about it. I shouldn't wonder if we came
to a loadstone mountain, which would draw all our
steel and iron articles into it, like the nails in Sindbad's
ship! It would be lovely to see everything take
flight through the air, from the axes and revolvers to
the old mare's shoes."</p>

<p>The girl smiled at this extravagance, but relapsed
into her expression of habitual seriousness as she
answered, "Who knows but that we may want the
revolvers? At any moment war may break out. We
are like the Rotorua natives, I am afraid, walking
on thin crust."</p>

<p>"I have skated on thin ice before now," he said,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

"but water and fire are different things. It seems
uncanny to be on land where your walking-stick
smokes if you poke it more than an inch into the
soil. So this is the famous and sacred valley!"</p>

<p>"Here we are," said Warwick, who now joined
them, "and I am not sorry. This sandy road takes
it out of one ever so much more than the forest
country. Our autumn sun, too, is fairly hot at midday.
The <i>Wahines</i> felt it, carrying their loads up
some of the hills."</p>

<p>"They seem to me to be given the heaviest
packs," said Massinger, rather indignantly. "Why
doesn't that hulking fellow Ngarara carry part of one
at any rate?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, he is a chief and has 'no back'&mdash;that
is to say, he is absolved from bearing burdens.
His person is sacred to that extent. I don't like
him personally, but he is within his rights."</p>

<p>"I should like to kick him," said the Englishman;
"he wants some of the nonsense taken out of him."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't advise any hasty act," said Warwick,
looking grave. "He is a person of some consequence,
and you would bring the whole tribe down upon us,
as they would consider themselves insulted in his
person; particularly now, as no one knows what may
happen within a week or two. As for the women,
poor things, they are used to it. They do much of
the work of the tribe, and don't object to fighting on
occasion."</p>

<p>"It is too true," said Erena. "I am always
ashamed to see the tremendous loads they carry in
the <i>kumera</i> season; and in the planting, digging, and
weeding of those plantations that look so neat near

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>

the <i>kaingas</i>, they do far more than their share. I
suppose women in Europe don't work in the fields?"</p>

<p>"Well," returned Massinger, rather taken aback,
"I am afraid I must own that <em>they do</em>, now I come
to think of it. They hoe turnip and potato fields,
reap and bind in harvest time; and, yes, the fishermen's
wives and the colliers' daughters work&mdash;pretty
hard, too. In France and Germany I have often
thought they worked harder than the men."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," said Erena, with a flash of her large
dark eyes, illumined with a sudden fire, which completely
altered the expression of her countenance.
"Men are alike in all countries. They take the easy
work, under pretence of responsibility, and leave the
drudgery to the poor women. In one respect, however,
we have the advantage. We can speak and vote in
the councils of the tribe."</p>

<p>"You don't say so! I should like to hear you
speak in public, above all things. Have you ever
done so?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said she, relapsing into seriousness;
"and if certain events come to pass, you may hear
me make more than one speech in the <i>runanga</i> before
the year is out."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" he said, gazing at her with
admiration, as she stood in classic pose, with fixed
gaze, and every graceful outline denoting arrested
motion.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>"I thought it better to strike across to this valley
of Waiotapu first," said Warwick, "though Erena was
in favour of going straight to Rotorua. However, she
now agrees with me, that you can have a foretaste of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>

volcanic action here, and take the main Taupo road
to the terraces, returning by Rotorua, which is the
home of the <i>hapu</i>, or section of her tribe."</p>

<p>"It is, after all, the best route, perhaps," said she,
smiling frankly. "You can reach the terraces easily
now, and afterwards rest at Rotorua before returning
to Auckland. There is also another reason."</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired Massinger, as he saw
the girl's face change, and her eyes once more become
clouded over with the mysterious sadness which from
time to time dimmed her brightest expression.</p>

<p>"I am nearly certain that there will be an outbreak&mdash;perhaps
even war declared&mdash;before we return. In
that case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In that case I should join the first body of volunteers
I could come at, or your own loyal tribe, if it
remains so."</p>

<p>"I have every belief that Waka Nene will remain as
true to your people as he was in the old war, when he
fought against Heke, and did such good work in beating
back Kawiti. My mother's brother, a noted chief, died
fighting for your people. But this will bring the tribes
nearer together; they may make common cause against
the pakeha. It will be a fight to the death. Some of
the friendly tribes may waver. I would advise your
going to your own people without delay from Rotorua."</p>

<p>"And how about a guide? Warwick may not care
to undertake the task in the face of&mdash;what may happen."</p>

<p>"In that case"&mdash;and as she spoke, her inmost
soul seemed to look forth in high resolve through the
lustrous eyes, now informed with the mystic fire of
the sybil&mdash;"I will ensure you a guide who knows the
secret paths even better than Warwick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Massinger said no more. The countenance of
Warwick wore a look of mingled doubt and admiration,
after which he ordered the attendant natives to
make the usual arrangements for a camp.</p>

<p>"We shall need no fire, that is one thing," he
said, turning to the Englishman.</p>

<p>"How is that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nature is good enough to contract for the cooking
here, which is the least she can do before she blows them
all up some fine day. Just watch these people directly."</p>

<p>As indeed he did, much marvelling.</p>

<p>First of all, two of the women cleared a space,
about three feet long and two wide, in the warm
earth; into this they placed a layer of stones, which
they covered with leaves. Upon this were placed the
pork, the <i>kumeras</i>, and some pigeons shot on the way,
all of which were rapidly and satisfactorily cooked. The
evening meal, so miraculously prepared, as it seemed,
having been concluded, Erena retired with her female
attendants, pleading the necessity for a night's rest to
prepare them for the opening day of the Great Exhibition.
The two men walked up and down, smoking
the meditative pipe. But long after his companion
had retired to rest, Massinger lay awake, unable to
sleep amid the strange, almost preternatural, features
of the locality, while the anticipation of a war between
his countrymen and this stubborn and revengeful people
taxed his brain with incessantly recurring thoughts.</p>

<p>What would be the first act in the drama? He
thought of isolated families of the settlers, now living
in apparent peace and security, abandoned to the
cruelty of a remorseless enemy. Would the horrors
of Indian warfare be repeated? Would a partial

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

success, which, from their advantageous position, and
the absence of any large body of regular troops, the
natives were likely to gain, be avenged by merciless
slaughter? In either case, what bloodshed, agony,
wrongs irrevocable and unspeakable, were certain to
ensue! What would be the outcome? He thought
of the farmsteadings he had seen, with neat homesteads,
garnered grain, contented hardy workers, their
rosy-cheeked children playing amidst the orchards.
Were these to be left desolate, burned, ravaged, as
would be inevitable with all outside the line of
defence? Then, again, the populous <i>kaingas</i>, with
grave <i>rangatiras</i> and stalwart warriors; the merry
chattering <i>wahines</i>, sitting amid their children when
the day was over, much like other people's wives and
children, enjoying far more natural comfort than the
British labourers' families&mdash;were they also to be driven
from their pleasant homes, starved, harried, pursued
night and day by the avenger of blood? Like the
heathen of old, dislodged by the chosen people with
so little mercy? The carefully kept <i>kumera</i> plantations,
so promising for another season, were they to
be plundered or destroyed? The lines from Keble
returned to his memory&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"It was a piteous sight, I ween, to mark the heathen's toil&mdash;</span>
      <span class="i1">The limpid wells, the orchards green, left ready for the spoil."</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Was all this murder and misery to take place because
the representatives of a great nation differed with a
quasi-barbarous, but distinctly dignified, lord of the
manor about the title to an area of comparatively
small value when compared with the millions of acres
of arable and pasture still for sale, undisputed?</p>

<p>A contention as to title by English law ousted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>

the jurisdiction of magistrates in an assault case.
Why should not this paltry squabble about an insignificant
portion await an authoritative legal decision?
No people apparently understood the deliberate verdict
of a Court better than these Maoris. Delay, even protracted
delay, would have been truly wise and merciful
in view of the grisly alternative of war. Such a war,
too, as it was likely to be!</p>

<p>However, though Erena and Warwick were confident
of a fight, no official notice had yet reached
them. It might yet be avoided, and so hoping, after
hearing with increasing distinctness all manner of
strange and fearful sounds, above, around, beneath,
our traveller fell asleep.</p>

<p>The morning proved fine. As Massinger left his
couch, the half-arisen sun was reluming a landscape
neither picturesque nor alluring. Wild and wondrous
it certainly was; upon such the eyes of the pakeha had
never before rested. The elements had apparently
been at play above and below the earth's surface,
which showed signs of no common derangement.
Rugged defiles, strangely assorted hillocks of differing
size, colour, and elevation. A scarred volcanic cone
poured out steam from its base upward, while, between
the whirling mists, igneous rocks glinted, like red-hot
boulders, in the morning sun. Near this strange
mountain was a lake, the glittering green of which
contrasted with the darkly red incrustations heaped
upon its margin. Looking southward, a sense of
Titanic grandeur was added to the landscape by a
vast snow-covered range, on the hither side of which,
he had been told, lay the waters of the historic Taupo&mdash;Taupo
Moana, "The Moaning Sea."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Strolling</span> back to camp, his movements were quickened
by observing that the rest of the party had
finished the morning meal, and were only awaiting
his arrival to commence the first day's sight-seeing.
After a council of war, it was finally decided to remain
in the valley for the rest of the day, making for
Taupo and Rotomahana on the morrow.</p>

<p>"In this valley of Waiotapu," said Warwick, "you
have a good idea, on a small scale, of Rotomahana and
the terraces. The same sorts of pools are on view;
you have also the feeling of being on the lid of a
boiling cauldron, and can realize most of the sensations
belonging to a place where you may be boiled
alive or burnt to death at any moment."</p>

<p>"A romantic ending," replied Massinger; "but I
don't wish to end my New Zealand career in such a
strictly Maori fashion. What is one to do, to avoid
incensing the <i>Atua</i> of this very queer region?"</p>

<p>"Be sure to follow me or Erena most carefully,
and do not step away from the path, or into any water
that you have not tried. One traveller did so, and,
as it was at boiling heat, died next day, poor fellow!
So now, let us begin. Do you see this yellow waterbasin?

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

This is the champagne pool. For the champagne,
watch this effect." Here a couple of handfuls
of earth were thrown in. Thereupon the strange
water commenced to effervesce angrily, the circles
spreading until the outermost edges of the pool were
reached. "The outlet, you see, is over that slope,
and is known as the Primrose Falls. But we must
not linger. Beyond that boiling lake, with the steam
clouds hanging over it, lies a terrace, gradually sloping,
with ripples in the siliceous deposit, finally ending in
miniature marble cascades."</p>

<p>"All this is wonderful and astonishing, but it is
only the beginning of the play. I shall reserve my
applause until the last act. I have been in strange
places abroad, but never saw so many different sorts
of miracles in one collection. What are those cliffs,
for instance, so white and glistening?"</p>

<p>"The Alum Cliffs, sparkling with incrustations of
alum. You notice that they rise almost perpendicularly
from the hot-water pools? In contrast, the
colour of the surrounding earth varies from pale yellow
to Indian red and crimson. Some of the crystals you
see around are strongly acid. The pools are all sorts
of colours: some like pots of red paint, others green,
blue, pink, orange, and cream."</p>

<p>"Evidently Nature's laboratories. What she will
evolve is as yet unknown to us. Let us hope it will
be more or less beneficial."</p>

<p>"It is hard to say," replied Warwick, musingly.
"There is a legend among the Maoris that, many
generations since, this valley, now so desolate, was
covered with villages, the soil being very productive;
that the inhabitants displeased the local Atua, upon

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

which he ordered a volcano in the neighbourhood to
pour forth its fiery flood. An eruption followed, which
covered the village many feet deep with the scoria
and mud which, in a hardened state, you now see."</p>

<p>"Highly probable. I can believe anything of this
sulphur-laden Valley of the Shadow. And did the
mountain disappear also?"</p>

<p>"No! there he stands, three thousand feet high,
quite ready, if one may judge from appearances, for
another fiery shower. Let us hope he will not do it
in our time. In the mean time, look at this Boiling
Lake. Is not the water beautifully blue? And what
clouds of steam! It is much the same, except in size,
as the one above the Pink Terrace."</p>

<p>The day wore on as they rambled from one spot
to another of the magical region.</p>

<p>"It is a city of the genii," said Massinger, as he
watched the guide apply a match to one of a number
of metallic-looking mounds, which promptly caught
fire, and blazed until quenched. "Where in the world,
except a naphtha lake, could one find such an inflammable
rest for the sole of one's foot? I believe the
place is one-half sulphur, and the other imprisoned
fire, which will some day break forth and light up
such a conflagration of earth, sky, and water, as the
world has not seen for centuries. See here"&mdash;as,
driving the end of his walking-stick into the crumbling
earth, it began to smoke&mdash;"it is too hot to hold
already."</p>

<p>The sun was low, as the little party, having lunched
at a bungalow specially erected for tourists, took the
homeward route.</p>

<p>"There is one more sight, and not the least of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>

series," said Warwick, as they approached a curious
soot-coloured cone, from which, of course, steam
ascended, and strange sounds, with intermittent
groanings, made themselves heard.</p>

<p>"The powers be merciful to us mortals, who can
but believe and tremble!" ejaculated Massinger.
"What demon's kitchen is this?"</p>

<p>"Only a mud volcano," answered Warwick. "Let
us climb to the top and look in."</p>

<p>The mound, formed by the deposit of dried mud,
some ten or twelve feet high, was easily ascended.
Open at the top, it was filled with a boiling, opaque
mass of seething, bubbling mud. Ever and anon
were thrown up fountain-like spurts, which turned
into grotesque shapes as they fell on the rim of
the strange cauldron. A tiny dab fell upon Erena's
<i>kaitaka</i>. She laughed.</p>

<p>"It will do this no harm; but it might have been
my face. A mud scald is long of healing."</p>

<p>"What an awful place to fall into alive!" said
Massinger, as he gazed at the steaming, impure liquid.
"Is it known that any one ever slipped over the edge?"</p>

<p>"More than one, if old tales are true," said Warwick;
"but they were <em>thrown in</em>, with bound hands,
after battle. It was a choice way of disposing of a
favourite enemy. He did not always sink at once;
but none ever came out, dead or alive."</p>

<p>"Let us go on!" said Erena, impatiently. "I cannot
bear to think of such horrors. I suppose all nations
did dreadful things in war."</p>

<p>"And may again," interposed Warwick. "These
people were not worse than others long ago. The
Druids, with their wicker cages filled with roasting

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>

victims, were as well up to date as my Maori ancestors.
Luckily, such things have passed away for ever."</p>

<p>"Let us trust so," said Massinger, feelingly.</p>

<p>Erena made no answer, but walked forward
musingly on the track which led in the direction of
the camp.</p>

<p>"Though narrow, it appears to have been much
used," he remarked.</p>

<p>"It is an old war-path," replied the guide. "When
the Ngapuhi came down from Maketu on their raids,
they mostly used this route. I am not old enough to
have seen anything of Heke's war in '45. It was the
first real protest against the pakeha. The natives
were beginning to be afraid, very reasonably, that the
white man would take the whole country. If the
tribes had been united, they could have defied any
force then brought against them, and driven your
people into the sea."</p>

<p>"And why did they not make common cause?"</p>

<p>"The old story. Blood-feuds had embittered one
tribe against another. Chiefs of ability and forecast,
like Waka Nene and Patuone, his brother, saw that
they must be beaten in the long run. They allied
themselves with the British. They had embraced
Christianity, and remained faithful to the end, fighting
against the men of their own blood without the least
regard to their common origin."</p>

<p>"I need not ask you," said Massinger, "on which
side your sympathies are enlisted."</p>

<p>"No! it goes without saying," answered the guide.
"I have had a fair education; I have been about the
world, and I cannot help recognizing the resistless
power of England, against which it would be madness

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

to contend. I should never think of joining the
natives in case of war. A war which is coming, from
all I hear. At the same time, I cannot help feeling
for them. Amid these woods, lakes, and through
these mountains and valleys, their ancestors roamed
for centuries. No people in the world are more deeply
attached to their native land. Think how hard for
them to be dispossessed."</p>

<p>"And have you an alternative to offer?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, if war breaks out. It is idle to
expect that New Zealand, able to support millions of
civilized people, should be abandoned to less than a
hundred thousand savages; for such, with exceptions,
I am afraid I must call them. As for justice and
mercy in dealing with conquered races, these are mere
words. <em>Force</em> is the only law, as it has ever been.
What mercy did the Maoris show to their conquered
enemies? They slew, enslaved, tortured&mdash;and worse!
They exterminated weak tribes, and took their lands.
They have little ground for complaint if a nation
stronger in war applies the same measure to them."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," said Massinger, "upon the
logical view which you take of the question. But
is there no way of reconciling the interests of the
colonists and the children of the soil?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. If they are cool enough on both sides
to adjourn this paltry dispute about the Waitara block
until it can be settled by legal authority or arbitration,
war might be avoided. No people are more obedient
to law, when they properly understand it. They are
naturally litigious, and enjoy a good long-winded lawsuit.
If they were convinced that they were getting
fair play in an arbitration, which I should recommend&mdash;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>

and there are available men, like Mannering or Waterton,
who understand thoroughly the people and their
customs, and are trusted by both sides&mdash;I believe they
would cheerfully abide by an award."</p>

<p>"Then as to the sale of lands, disputed titles, upset
price, and so on?"</p>

<p>"I believe that they are getting justice from the
present land tribunals apart from political pressure,
which would weaken in time; and if they do not get
it from England, I do not know, speaking from experience
and reading, from what other nation to expect
it. There must be delay and litigation, but they will
be satisfied in the end."</p>

<p>"And if not, and war breaks out?"</p>

<p>"Then there will be bloodshed to begin with,
murder, outrage; all things which lead to unpardonable
crimes on both sides; blood-feuds which will last
for generations."</p>

<p>"A man like you might do much good in the
legislature. Why do you not come forward, when
inferior people of my own nation, from what I hear,
degrade our parliamentary system?"</p>

<p>"The time is not yet," he answered. "We shall
soon have other matters to think of. When we get
back to Auckland there will be very little political
business for some time to come."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Onward, and still onward. Fresh marvels of scenery
seemed hourly opening before them. In pride of
place, Tongariro, fire-breathing Titan, with volcanic
cone, encircled by his stupendous mountain range. As
they gazed, the ceaseless steam-clouds, now enveloping
the summit, now wind-driven sportively, as if by a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>

giant's breath, exposed to view the darkened rim of
the crater.</p>

<p>To the right of Tongariro, more than five thousand
feet in height, they saw the heaven-piercing bulk of
Ruapehu (eight thousand nine hundred feet), cloud-crowned,
lava-built, but girdled with ice-fields at a
lower altitude; and at the base, arising from gloomy
forests, valleys seamed and fissured, precipices, ravines,
and outlined terraces.</p>

<p>"What a land of contrasts!" said the Englishman.
"The sublime, the dread and awful, the idyllic and
peaceful rural, seem mingled together in the wildest
profusion; fire and water conflicting furiously in the
same landscape. Nature appears to have thrown her
properties and elements about without plan or method."</p>

<p>"A strange country!&mdash;a strange people!" exclaimed
Erena. "Is that what you are thinking of? Surely
you cannot expect an ordinary population amid scenes
like these. I fear that we resemble our country in
being calm as the sleeping sea, until the storm of
passion is aroused."</p>

<p>"And then?" queried he.</p>

<p>"Then, if we feel injured, cruel as the grave,
merciless, remorseless. So beware of us! We make
bad enemies, I confess; but, then, we are always ready
to die for our friends."</p>

<p>"I am numbered, I trust, among that favoured
class, am I not?" he continued, as he gazed at the
girl's face, wearing as it did a sudden look of high-souled
resolve.</p>

<p>So might have looked, so posed, the daughter of
Jephthah; so, scorning fate and the dark death, stood
Iphigenia as she awaited the blow of doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The expression of her face changed; a wistful, half-pleading
look came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why ask?" she said softly. "You know that
you are; that you always will be."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>And now, after a passage across the pumice-strewn
levels, lo! Taupo the sacred, Taupo-Moana,
the moaning sea.</p>

<p>There was no thought of unsatisfied expectation
as Massinger gazed upon the glorious sheet of water,
over which the eye wandered until the darksome
shadows of Kaimanawa and Tankaru dimmed its
azure surface&mdash;the vast mountain range, from which,
on Tongariro, a mathematically correct cinder-cone
sprang upwards, like the spire of a gigantic
minster.</p>

<p>On the other side, the peak of Tauhara, 3600
feet in height, stood out in lone majesty. The twin
Titan, Ruapehu, bared his enormous shoulder to
the unclouded sky. The day was wonderfully fine,
having the softened atmospheric tone peculiar to the
later summer months of the northern island. Then
gradually a delicate haze crept over the horizon,
shading the stern outlines of the dark-browed Alp.
The foot-hills seemed to have approached through
the clear yet tinted lights of the fading day.</p>

<p>"When have I seen such a panorama before?"
thought Massinger. "What vastness, what sublimity,
in all its component parts! Then, as columns of
steam rose in the far distance, completing the weird
and abnormal effects of the unfamiliar vision, speech,
even exclamation, appeared to fail him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yonder stands the <i>pah</i> of his Majesty, King
Te Heu Heu, the head chief of all this district,"
interposed Warwick. "We must send forward a
herald and pay our respects, or our visit may not be
so successful. He has a queer temper, and is as proud
as if he had been sent from heaven. There is his
castle."</p>

<p>"Warwick is right," said Erena, coming up at
this juncture and arousing herself from the reverie
into which she, too, appeared to have fallen. "This
is his kingdom, and we must do <i>tika</i>. We can rest
for to-night, however, and give Te Heu Heu the
second proper warning, so that he can receive us in
state. I wish you could have seen the <em>real</em> Te Heu
Heu, however."</p>

<p>"Why so? and what was his special distinction?"</p>

<p>"Something truly uncommon, personally. You
would then have carried away an idea of a Maori
Rangatira&mdash;one of the olden time. A giant in stature,
he must have resembled old Archibald Douglas in
'Marmion'&mdash;'So stern of look, so huge of limb.' He
lived in a valley some distance from here, among the
hills you see yonder. But life in these regions has
always been uncertain. One fine night&mdash;or perhaps
it was a stormy one, for there had been a deluge of
rain&mdash;the soil about here in the valley, even the rocks,
they say, became loosened and came down in a kind
of avalanche. It filled the whole valley, covering up
Te Heu Heu, his people, his wives and children, numbering
in all some seventy souls. They were never
seen alive or heard of any more. There was a lament
composed by his brother to his memory. I remember
a verse or two.</p>

<p>There are as many more verses," said Erena,
"but I have forgotten them. They all express the
deepest feeling of grief&mdash;almost despair&mdash;as, indeed,
do most of the Maori love-songs and laments. The
grief was by no means simulated in the case of relations.
I know myself of several suicides which took
place immediately after funerals or disappointments
in love."</p>

<p>"There is strong poetic feeling, with a high degree
of imagination, in the native poems and orations,"
said Massinger. "It is a pity that these recitations
should die out."</p>

<p>"The Te Heu Heu we refer to was a remarkable
man," said Warwick. "Standing as near seven feet as
six, he looked, I have heard people say, the complete
embodiment of the Maori chief of old days&mdash;terrible in
peace or war; and, arrayed in his cloak of ceremony,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>

with the <i>huia</i> feathers in his hair, and his <i>merepounamou</i>
in his right hand, was enough to strike terror into the
heart of the bravest."</p>

<p>"Didn't he refuse to sign the Treaty of
Waitangi?" said Massinger.</p>

<p>"Of course he did. It was just like his pride and
disdain of a superior. 'You may choose to be slaves
to the pakeha,' he said scornfully to the assembled
chiefs, as he turned away; 'I am Te Heu Heu!'"</p>

<p>The <i>pah</i>, or fortress, of the present chieftain
was one of considerable strength and pretension,
covering an area of nearly five acres. Reared upon
a promontory which prevented assault, except by
water, on three sides, it was well calculated to defy
all manner of enemies in the good old days before
breechloaders and artillery. The whole area was walled
in, so to speak, with excessively strong palisades,
the only entrance being by heavy sliding gates. This
historic keep possessed all the natural advantages of
the sites selected for the purpose, with the important
addition of unlimited water-supply. Scarcity of the
indispensable requisite, rarely possible to secure on
the summit of a hill, often led to the surrender of
the castle when besieged for sufficient time to
exhaust the water-store. One of the ancient Maori
romances, indeed, describes the dramatic incident of
a beleaguered garrison, including the aged chief, at
the point of death from thirst. The youthful leader
of the besieging force, touched by the beauty of his
daughter, the far-famed Ranmahora, relieves the
veteran's suffering, and naturally receives the hand of
the maiden, after which peace is ratified, amid general
congratulations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Te Heu Heu's <i>pah</i> might be considered to be
almost impregnable, having in addition to the trenches
and galleries, double and treble lines of defence,
which in other days proved so formidable to regular
troops. Besides these were lines of pits, lightly
covered over and thus used to entrap enemies. Also,
another series used for storing provisions. When
understood that these well-planned and scientific
strongholds were constructed by a barbaric race
with but stone and wooden implements, one can but
wonder at the patient industry, joined to a high
order of intelligence, displayed in their formation.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Sunrise all goldenly reluming a wonder-world!
The calm waters of the lake stretching beyond the
limit of vision as they gazed upon the sea-like expanse;
the dread mountain kings crowned with eternal snow,
girt with fire, ringed with ice-fields, based on primeval
forests! Mortal man surely never looked upon so
strange a scene&mdash;so crowded with all the elements of
beauty, terror, and sublimity.</p>

<p>"Well worth the voyage," thought Massinger&mdash;"the
dissevering of familiar ties and associations&mdash;but
to have enjoyed this intoxicating experience!" How
poor, how narrow the life which contented his compatriots!&mdash;which
contented <em>him</em> before the Great
Disaster, when his flight to this Ultima Thule appeared
the welcome resort of a man careless of the
future, if only relief might be gained from the intolerable
anguish of the present.</p>

<p>Now how different were his feelings! The hard
fare, the toilsome march, the hourly novelty, the
certainty of adventure, and the approach of danger,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>

seemed to have changed not only his habits of
thought, but his very nature. As he reflected upon
the exhaustless field of enterprise which seemed
opening around him, he almost shouted aloud with
the joy of living and the anticipation of triumph.</p>

<p>Warwick had made an early visit to the potentate,
who was, as he well knew, monarch of all he surveyed
in the region of Taupo Moano. He had enlarged
upon the rank and wealth of Massinger until a cloud
was cleared from the mind of the chief, not unreasonably
disposed to connect the arrival of an unknown
pakeha with designs upon his hereditary lands.</p>

<p>When assured that his visitor was only moved by
curiosity to behold the wonders of which all the world
had heard, as well as to pay a visit of ceremony to
the great chief Te Heu Heu, he became mollified, and
expressed his desire to converse with the Rangatira
Pakeha, who had come across the sea to behold the
great lake Taupo and the wonder-mountains. Tongariro
and Ruapehu.</p>

<p>At the hour of midday, therefore, Massinger,
accompanied by Warwick and Erena, presented
himself before the chief, who, standing in front of a
<i>wharepuni</i> of unusual size, with elaborate carvings
upon its massive doorposts, received him with perfect
dignity and self-possession. The remainder of the
party had been left with the camp-stores and belongings,
it not having been thought necessary to include
them in the interview.</p>

<p>The chief relaxed his stern features as Erena
approached, and said a few words in his native tongue
to her, which she answered with quiet composure.
He then turned to Warwick, who appeared anxious

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

to explain their position, and mentioned the name of
Waka Nene, which produced a distinct effect upon
the chief's manner and demeanour.</p>

<p>"You are on the path to Rotomahana," said he.
"It is a far journey to see the boiling fountain and
the white steps of Te Tarata."</p>

<p>Massinger, through the guide: "I have heard
much of these strange things. I have seen pictures
of them. We have no hot lakes or burning mountains
in my country."</p>

<p>"Then you will see them and go away; you are
a strange people. You do not want to buy the land?
No? I would sell you some if you would live here."</p>

<p>It was explained to the chief that the pakeha
desired land that would grow corn. The land around
Taupo was good to look at, but not for farmers. He
thought he would buy land near Auckland.</p>

<p>"Does the pakeha know that there is much talk
of war in the land? The Mata Kawana at Waitemata
is deceived by bad men. He is paying Teira
for land which is not his to sell. If the Mata Kawana
takes it by force, there will be blood&mdash;much blood.
Te Rangituke will not suffer the land of his people
to be taken. <i>Akore, akore!</i>"</p>

<p>"This pakeha does not come to fight; he wishes
to live on land near the Maoris. He will pay them
money and buy the land."</p>

<p>"The pakeha is good; his word is strong. I
should much like him to live here. Let him ask
Erena in marriage from her father, and his days will
be many."</p>

<p>"The pakeha does not desire to marry just at
present, even if Erena would accept him. His heart

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

is in his own land. He wishes to see all the country
before he settles down."</p>

<p>"That is well. The bird flies all round before
he perches. But if the tribes dance the war-dance,
on account of this trouble about the Waitara, what
will he do then? The first <i>taua</i> of the Ngatiawa that
he meets will kill him."</p>

<p>"The pakeha is brave. He can shoot a man afar
off. He will go back to Waitemata or die. He has
also a letter from Waka Nene."</p>

<p>"That is good for the Arawa and the Ngapuhi,
but the Waikato will not regard it. It may be that
the white man's Atua will keep him from harm."</p>

<p>With which sentiment the audience terminated.</p>

<p>With the exception of the world-famed terraces, no
spot on earth was so rich in strange and wondrous
surroundings as this great lake of unfathomable depth,
a thousand feet above the sea, sleeping amidst its
volcanic blocks of quartzose lava and huge masses of
pumice-stone. To the north-west they gazed at the
wooded ridges of Rangitoto and Tuhua, and, three
thousand feet above the sea, the bare turreted pyramids
of Titerau, towering in pride, as might, on the castled
Rhine, the ruined fortress of a forgotten robber-baron.
White pumice-stone cliffs gleaming in the sun bordered
the eastern shore. Behind the sombre forest ranges,
pyramidal monoliths, piercing the heavens at yet
greater altitudes, gave to this amazing landscape the
fantastic aspect of a dream-world.</p>

<p>"When shall we awaken?" said Massinger, as
he and Erena, lingering behind their guide as they
strolled towards the camp, became conscious that the
day was declining. "This is the newest land of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

enchantment. I feel like a lotus-eater, removed from
the world of everyday life. I could almost be
tempted to cast in my lot with this careless-living
race, wandering here till life grew dim, and the distinctions
between what our fathers used to call right
and wrong faded into uncertainty. I can imagine
some men doing it."</p>

<p>"But not you. Oh! do not talk in that reckless
fashion. Another might waste his life among these
poor ignorant people; but you have a man's work
yet to do in the world&mdash;a name to make, a family to
remember. But"&mdash;as he smiled at her vehemence&mdash;"you
are only joking; you are laughing at the poor
Maori girl, who thought for a moment that you were
in earnest. Let us walk faster; it will soon be dark,
and we have some distance still to go."</p>

<p>A change seemed suddenly to have come over the
spirit of the girl. From being carelessly playful in
manner, as she had been in their rambles all the day,
she became silent and reserved till they reached the
camp. There she retired at once to where the other
women had fixed their quarters, merely remarking
that they would have to leave early if they hoped to
reach the terraces.</p>

<p>The night was strangely, magically lovely. Massinger
had no great desire to sleep. He felt, indeed,
that one might easily watch till dawn amid
this region of magic and sorcery. Brightly burned
the stars in the dark blue heavens. There was no
moon, but the constellations, to his excited fancy,
seemed strangely lustrous and of intense, almost
unreal, brilliancy. Warwick and he stood near their
camp fire, only occasionally speaking, when all suddenly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>

there arose a wild shout, then a succession of cries,
from the direction of Te Heu Heu's <i>pah</i>, which pointed
to some unusual occurrence. A wailing cry came,
too, from the natives of their own encampment, whom
they observed to have left their <i>whares</i> and gathered
in a group.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" said Massinger,
who had been gazing over the lake, and listening to
the low calls and whispering notes of the water-fowl
which sailed in flocks amid its sedges and reeds.
"What do they mean by that long-drawn sound? And
now there is a shout&mdash;a sort of herald's proclamation."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Warwick. "The Tohunga
calls aloud, 'Behold the sacred fire on Tongariro! The
Atua commands war. Listen, O men of the Arawa.</p>

<p>"'The pakeha desires to take the country of the
<i>nga iwi</i> (the tribes). He will take the forests and the
kumera plantations, the valleys and the mountains,
the rivers and the shores of the sea. The Maori canoe
will no longer be paddled on the broad bosom of the
Waikato, on lakes which have been our fathers since
they came from Hawaiki. The steamboat will drive
away the Maori canoe; the sheep and cattle of the
pakeha will feed on our plantations; the white magistrates
will put our young men in prison; our old
men will break stones for the pakeha roads. We
shall all be slaves, working for a pakeha conqueror.</p>

<p>"'Shall we be slaves, or shall we unite and march
against the pakeha?'"</p>

<p>A thousand voices shouted till the echoes by the
lake shore rang again with cries as of one man&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Akore, akore, akore!</i>"</p>

<p>"If we are not willing to be slaves, shall the tribes,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>

the Waikato and the Ngatiawa, join together and drive
the pakeha into the sea from whence he came?"</p>

<p>Then one more deep-drawn shout of assent
resounded through the still night-air.</p>

<p>"You see what the feeling is," said Warwick,
turning as he spoke. "Look yonder, and behold the
fire on Tongariro!"</p>

<p>Massinger swung round, and, to his great surprise,
saw amidst a cloud of steam, high up on the mountain,
a red band of fire, which seemed to encircle the upper
portion of the cinder-cone which formed so remarkable
an addition to the summit. A fresh volume of steam
rose pillar-like from the crater, while from time to
time angry bursts of flame issued from the top and
sides of the cone.</p>

<p>"A very grand sight," he said; "but what is
there to create such a disturbance? It is surely not an
unusual occurrence in this land of imprisoned fires?
Is that the meaning of all this outcry?"</p>

<p>"That, and nothing else," replied the guide; "but
it is by no means an ordinary occurrence. It is now
many years since such a thing has taken place.
But all the excitement arises out of an old superstition."</p>

<p>"And what may that be?"</p>

<p>"In olden times the appearance of fire upon
Tongariro was regarded as a mandate from their
Atua to wage war&mdash;which they invariably did. Occasions
were not far to seek, as there was always a
weaker tribe to attack or a strong one to measure
forces with. But now it means more&mdash;much more.
And that is why these natives are so excited."</p>

<p>"But why should it mean more now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"For this reason. Every tribe in the North Island
knows that this Waitara land trouble is likely to
cause a break-out at any moment. They look upon
this fire on Tongariro as a call to arms against the
whites; and if there has been serious dispute at
Waitara there will be a war, and a bloody one, as
sure as we stand here."</p>

<p>"And with what result?"</p>

<p>"Of course, they will be beaten in the end. But
it will be a longer business than people would think.
The tribes are armed, and, having made money for
some years past, these Waikato and Ngatihaua have
invested in firearms. They have the advantage of
knowing every foot of the country, and your troops
will fight at a disadvantage. However, I see Te Heu
Heu's people are quiet again, and our party have
returned to their <i>whares</i>; so we may as well turn in."</p>

<p>Next morning Massinger was surprised at Erena's
altered expression. Her usually bright and mirthful
manner had given way to one of brooding depression;
he in vain attempted to rally her.</p>

<p>"Surely you do not accept this natural occurrence
as a command from Heaven? What possible connection
can it have with the war, which I think unlikely
to take place, in spite of Warwick's opinion."</p>

<p>"He knows more than you do," she answered&mdash;"possibly
more than I myself, though of course the
natives talk to me freely. But something tells me,
in a manner that I cannot describe, that there will
be war. And what the end of it may be for you, for
me, for all of us, no mortal can tell."</p>

<p>"But surely it must be short," he answered.
"Troops and ships will come from the other colonies&mdash;from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>

England, even&mdash;if war is once declared. Then
what chance will these misguided natives have?"</p>

<p>"You will see&mdash;you will see," she said. "Pray God
it may not be so; and, indeed, my father's daughter
ought to fear nothing. It is not for myself. No!"
she said, raising her head proudly, "if I could die,
like the women of old, for my country, for my people,
all would be easy. But I see worse things in the
future&mdash;burning houses, women and children lying
dead, the young and old; the settlers driven from
their farms, after all their hard work and care; among
our people the slaughter of warriors, the chiefs lying
dead, the women and children starving! Oh, it is a
terrible picture! I dreamed that blood had been
shed, that more was to come."</p>

<p>"Why, you must be a prophetess!" said he, still
striving to lead her from such dark forebodings.
"You have been over-excited. I would not ridicule
your ideas for a moment, but, as we can hear and do
nothing till we get to Rotorua, suppose we agree to
put off the mention of terrible things which may never
come to pass, and enjoy what time we have among
these lovely terraces."</p>

<p>"After all," she said, as a smile rippled over her
expressive countenance, effacing for the moment every
trace of depression, "perhaps it is the better way. Life
is short at the best, and we need not cloud it more
than we can help. We are now close to Tarawera,
in some respects the most wonderful place of the
whole collection. Isn't there a peculiar grandeur
about it? The name means 'burnt cliffs.' Look at
the rocky bluffs, shaded by those beautiful <i>pohutus</i>!
That is Tarawera Mountain, with a crown of trees.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>

And see, that is our path that leads to Rotomahana,
by the south shore of the lake."</p>

<p>"We have now," said Warwick, "about ten miles
to travel before we reach Rotomahana. The path is
well marked but steep, and a fair climb."</p>

<p>The famous lake, when reached, was to Massinger
somewhat disappointing. It owed nothing to mere
extent or picturesque surroundings&mdash;a verdant-appearing
sheet of water, with marshy shores, surrounded by
treeless hills, covered with low-growing fern. But its
marvels were strongly in evidence. Its title to distinction
rests upon its high temperature and intense,
incessant thermal activity. Boiling water on either
shore issues from the soil. Pools of hot mud were
frequent in the marshes; gas-bubbles in the open
lake indicated a higher temperature near certain
parts. There it was dangerous to bathe (according
to Warwick), though at no great distance the water
was merely lukewarm. Springs of various characters
abounded, totally different from each other&mdash;alkaline,
saline, arsenical, sulphurous. The feathered tribes of
swimmers and waders, protected by the tribe until
the appointed season, were in flocks innumerable,
various of size, hue, and habit. The splendid <i>pukeha</i>
(<i>Porphyrio melanotus</i>), the graceful <i>torea</i>, or oyster-eater
(<i>Hæmatopus picatus</i>), the beautiful white-necked
"paradise" duck, with countless congeners, held high
revel, after the manner of their kind.</p>

<p>Here might one fancy that one of great Nature's
laboratories had been arrested until its beneficent
purpose was fulfilled; that, until the missing cycle
of centuries had rolled by, some high and glorious
development of the Almighty Hand had been delayed;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

that vain man had intruded upon the scene, with his
accustomed assurance, before the creative scheme had
been declared complete.</p>

<p>As the little group stood on <i>Te Terata</i>, or
"tattooed rock," projecting with terraced marble steps
into the lake, Massinger held his breath in wonder
and admiration while the glories of this unequalled
pageantry of the elements broke upon his senses. Earth
and air, fire and water, were here represented in strange
propinquity and hitherto unknown combinations.</p>

<p>A hundred feet above them, on the slope of the
fern-clad hill, they came to a huge boiling caldron,
enclosed in a crater with walls forty feet high, open
only on the lake side. The basin, spring-fed, is
nearly a hundred feet long, and more than half as
wide. Brimful was it with translucent water, which, in
that snow-white incrustated basin, was of an intense
turquoise blue. Cloud-masses of steam, reflecting the
lovely colour and confining the view, while enhancing
the effect, were pierced with the ceaseless sounds, which
are almost cries, of the tormented water. The silicious
deposit presented the appearance of a cataract, which,
dashing itself over a succession of gradually lowered
platforms, has been suddenly turned into stone. The
effect has been deliciously rendered by Mr. Domett
in his glorious poem, "Ranulph and Amohia"&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"A cataract, carved in Parian stone,</span>

      <span class="i1">Its showering snow cascades appear.</span>
      <span class="i1">Long ranges bright of stalactite,</span>
      <span class="i1">And sparry frets and fringes white,</span>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The silicates deposited from the ever-flowing water
had formed on the slope a succession of terraces of
purest white imaginable, such as no Parian marble
could surpass&mdash;delicate, pure, polished as of glass,
the lines of tracery like the finest lace, the colouring
of a lustre and variety unique and unparalleled.</p>

<p>The system of terraces and basins covered several
acres. Centuries, nay æons, must have been required
for the slow accumulation of these exquisite formations.
Commencing at the lake with shallow basins,
while farther up, the higher terraces, from three to
six feet high, are formed by a number of semicircular
stages varying in height. Each has a raised margin,
from which the slender stalactites hang down upon
the lower stage, encircling one or more basins, filled
with water of the purest, most resplendent blue.
The smaller cups represent so many natural baths,
which connoisseurs of the most refined luxury could
scarce have equalled&mdash;of different size and depth, too,
with every degree of temperature.</p>

<p>On reaching the highest terrace, they arrived at an
extensive platform, upon which were other basins of
temperature equally high.</p>

<p>A rocky island, covered with ferns and lycopodiums,
enabled them to view at ease the steaming water of
the caldron, and to mark the varying colours and strong
effects&mdash;the virgin white, the turquoise blue, the vivid
green of the surrounding vegetation, the crude red
of the bare walls of the crater, with the whirling
clouds of steam, the delicate shapes of the pure
marble-seeming stalactites, the incrustated branches,
with every leaf and twig snow white, all combined
in phantasmal, unearthly beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of my country now?" said
Erena, as they stood side by side, gazing at this
enchanted scene.</p>

<p>"The most marvellous play of light and colour that
my eyes ever rested on," said he. "I shall recall it to
my dying day. It is a privilege to have lived through
such an experience. Our old friend of the Arabian
Nights uses the only forms of description that can
approach it."</p>

<p>"I have been here more than once," said Erena,
"but I never felt its charm so keenly as on this
occasion. My father has a poetic soul and much
scientific knowledge; he carefully explained to me
its various beauties. But he was of opinion that
some day a tremendous convulsion would take place
and ruin all these glories for ever."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful idea! I am afraid you must
have inherited a turn for prophesying evil. I must
confess, however, that these imprisoned fire-spirits,
whatever they are, must have very little of the Maori
nature in them, if they let us off without a burst up.
And now, I suppose, it is 'Hey for Rotorua!'"</p>

<p>"I fear so," said the girl, with a half-sigh. "This
fairylike wayfaring is too pleasant to last. We may
hear news at Rotorua which will alter your plans."</p>

<p>"My plans are quite unfixed at present; but if war
breaks out it is hard to say what one may have to
do. I dare say I shall be in the thick of it."</p>

<p>"We must not forget that the pink terrace is yet
to be seen, and we may never have another opportunity
of seeing it together."</p>

<p>"I feel as if my mind would not contain any
more of wonder and admiration, but we dare not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>

leave any of the wonders of this unearthly region
unexplored."</p>

<p>Together, then, leaving Warwick to arrange for an
early morning departure, they watched the great
fountain of "Otuka-puarangi," on the west side of
the lake, discharge his azure overflow into a series
of terraces and basins. The fountain sprang from a
platform sixty feet above the lake and a hundred
yards long. The flooring on the terraces was of a
delicate pink hue; hence their name. In the background
was the great hot spring, a caldron of forty
to fifty feet in diameter, its naked walls, like the first
seen, coloured red, white, and yellow. At the foot
of the terraces they saw the great <i>solfa-terra</i> Te
Whaka-tara-tara.</p>

<p>The three principal personages remained in converse
long after the usual time of separation. The night
was fine, and the surroundings were foreign to the idea
of early repose. The sounds of the fire-breathing
agencies, above and below, grew more distinct in the
hush of night. An occasional steam jet shooting into
the air appeared like an emissary sent to warn of
approaching danger.</p>

<p>"I should like to have seen the terraces by night,"
said Massinger, "but it is not a country for late
travelling."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Warwick; "a false step, a
stumble into the wrong pool, has before now cost a
man his life. I once saw a poor dog scalded to
death in a moment. I think you will find Rotorua and
the Valley of Geysers sufficiently interesting. If you
care for Maori legends, you should ask Erena to tell
you the tale of her ancestress, the beautiful Hinemoa."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a pretty name! And was she an ancestress
of yours? What did she do to acquire immortality?&mdash;for
I have heard her name, as a heroine, without
being told the legend."</p>

<p>"When we reach Rotorua, I will show you Mokoia,
the island to which she swam," said Erena, with a
smile. "Also the point Wai-rere-wai on the mainland,
from which she started; besides the hot spring which
she reached, close to her lover's village. It is a long
swim, but I suppose the girls of her day were more
accustomed to the water than we are now."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The third day was nearing its close when the
little party, having skirted the three-cornered deep
blue lake of Taka-tapu, threaded the tangled forests
over the Waipa plain, and ascended the bare hills
of the range which looks on Rotorua. The lake,
gleaming in the sunlight, lay beneath them, with the
fumaroles, steam-hammers, and geysers of Whakarewarewa
in full blast.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was decided to camp on the border of the lake
between the village of Ohinemutu, where the old
historic <i>pah</i>, with its grim carven giants of the
Wharepuni, looks frowningly down upon the little
Roman Catholic chapel. Clouds of steam arose in
all directions above them, while the scattered pools
exhibited the pervading warmth combined with
sulphur fumes.</p>

<p>"We are now on historic ground," said Warwick;
"for, without counting Hinemoa&mdash;there is her island&mdash;all
manner of legends abound; some of them horrible
enough in all conscience, ghastly to a degree," he
continued, gazing across the lake. "Mokoia looks
peaceful enough now, with scarcely a hundred people
on it all told. Yet what tales those rocks could
tell! The island was a grand resort for the tribe in
the days before gunpowder. In war-time they could
paddle over from this side, and defy any enemy that
had arrived on foot. There was no waterway to
Rotorua. However, Hongi-ika-kai-tangata taught
them a lesson."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"When the tribe retired there, as usual, they did not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>

reckon on an unexpected move of the fiercest and most crafty chief of
his day, and that is saying a good deal if all tales be true."</p>

<p>"How did he get over without boats; for I take
it they didn't leave any canoes on the hither side?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. But he had plenty of man-power;
so, after sacking the Arawa stronghold (in 1823) on
the east coast, he dragged his fleet of canoes across
by a road which he made to Lake Rotoiti, and,
entering Rotorua, appeared with his fleet before the
astonished lake tribes. He made straight for Mokoia,
fell upon them with his customary ferocity, and, carrying
all before him, put to death all who escaped the
first assault. Of the whole seven hundred of the
Arawa, not one is said to have escaped."</p>

<p>"What a tragedy! But, of course, such stratagems
belonged to the accepted method of warfare of the
period?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Warwick. "Almost where we
stand now a chief's widow killed in cold blood (with
the tribe and the mission school children looking on)
a woman taken in war, as an offering to the memory
of her husband. The missionary in vain attempted
to prevent the sacrifice, the poor victim appealing
piteously to some relative to help her. But the
good man only endangered his own life, and did not
succeed in saving hers. At Matamata, Te Waharoa's
great fortress, when he was besieged by the Ngapuhi
under Tareha, he made an unexpected sortie, and,
capturing several prisoners, <em>crucified them</em> on the tall
posts of the <i>pah</i>&mdash;just like those you see there&mdash;in
the very sight of their friends, who retired in confusion.
But I see Erena coming this way, so I must

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>

stop these bloodcurdling stories; she has a strong
dislike to them."</p>

<p>While their appointed camp was being made ready,
they were taken by Warwick to the site of the Lost
Village, the scene of the extinction of a <i>hapu</i> of the
tribe as sudden and complete as the destruction of
that of Te Heu Heu.</p>

<p>They stood on a point of land running into the
lake. It was floored with masses of pumice-stone,
which the waves had worn into strange and fantastic
shapes. Here had been the encampment. The sites
of the dwellings, by no means unsubstantial, were
marked by walls, of which the lower stones only
remained. The apertures showed where the entrances
had been. On one fatal night the whole promontory
sank downwards, drowning the sleepers, and submerging
for ever the homes where generations had
lived and died.</p>

<p>Arrived at the camp, all things wore a most cheerful
aspect. The chief, according to Maori custom with
distinguished visitors, had sent down cooked food,
mats, and other gifts, intimating through a messenger
that he would be pleased to receive a visit from the
pakeha rangatira at his convenience on the morrow.</p>

<p>Erena arranged to abide with her friends or
relations until the morrow. The humbler natives
asked leave of Warwick to bestow themselves in the
village, while the sullen Ngarara, who had of late
remained among the rank and file, announced his
intention of coming for his pay in the morning, and
terminating his engagement there and then.</p>

<p>Warwick displayed no surprise at this announcement,
but told him that he might have his pay at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>

once. This offer he accepted, and departed with ill-concealed
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry to get clear of him," he said; "he
is a dangerous brute, and for some reason has taken
a dislike to both of us. I can see it in his face. I
had a hint, too, from one of the women not to trust
him."</p>

<p>"What earthly reason can he have? He has been
treated fairly all the way."</p>

<p>"It's hard to say. Maoris are like other people,
good and bad. I hope there will be no war-scare
till we get to Auckland, at any rate. He might take
the occasion to do you a bad turn; so it will be well
to be on your guard."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will get as good as he brings," said
Massinger, with the careless confidence of youth. "I
shall keep my powder dry, at any rate."</p>

<p>It was late before the two men separated for the
night. Warwick was led into legendary lore, of which
he had a prodigious quantity. He told so many tales
of battle, murder, and sudden death, that the Englishman
dreamed of cannibal feasts, sieges, and pitched
battles, with all manner of disquieting incidents, so
that the sun had risen when he awakened after a
broken night's rest.</p>

<p>His attendants were already in waiting, and before
he had finished breakfast Erena arrived, looking fresh
and animated. She had made some slight alteration
in her dress, and had placed some of the beautiful
feathers of the <i>huia</i> in her hair. Altogether, there
was a change in her mien, a sparkle in her expressive
eyes, a lightness in her step, an added tone of cheerfulness,
which Massinger could hardly account for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not avoid remarking upon it. "You
are surely not pleased at our parting, Erena?" he
said. "Warwick and I must start for Auckland
almost at once."</p>

<p>"So soon?" she said. "I hoped you might find
something to interest you here for a few days. There's
nothing so beautiful as Te Terata or Rotomahana;
still, there are strange things here too."</p>

<p>"It must all depend upon our news of the war.
It would be unwise to linger here after real fighting
has commenced."</p>

<p>"I would not have you do it for the world," said
she. "But I have a reason for not wishing you to
return before Monday which I cannot tell you now.
You will trust me, will you not?"</p>

<p>The girl's deep eyes seemed to glow with unusual
lustre as she made this appeal, stretching forth her
hands pleadingly, while her lip quivered as she looked
at him with a wistful expression he had never noticed
before.</p>

<p>"I dare say you know best," he said; "and after
all your kindness I could not refuse you anything.
But really this life is too pleasant&mdash;too much in the
way of holiday-making. I must begin to do some of
the work for which I came so far."</p>

<p>"You need not fret yourself over that part of it,"
she said. "You will have plenty of time to do all
that is necessary. Many Englishmen come out to
buy land, but they all wish they had waited before
investing their money."</p>

<p>"You only tell me what my friends said in Auckland,"
he answered. "I am sure your advice is good.
And now for our friend the Ariki of the lake tribes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Being joined by Warwick, they walked forward to
the spot where the chief had located himself. He
was surrounded by the elders of the tribe, as well as
by a considerable body of natives, among whom
Massinger noticed the ill-omened countenance of
Ngarara.</p>

<p>"That fellow has been talking to the natives," said
Warwick, "and whatever he has said, it is against us;
I can see by the chief's face. I am glad that Erena
is with us; she has great weight with the tribe."</p>

<p>The chief received them with a show of civility,
but was evidently on his guard, as having had his
suspicions aroused. He was anxious to know for what
reason Massinger had travelled to Taupo and Rotorua
after having come so far over the great sea.</p>

<p>"The pakeha is fond of strange sights. He has
never seen anything like Te Terata before, and was
most anxious to visit Rotorua, of which he had heard
much; also to pay his respects to the chief Hika-iro,
of whom he was told before he left Auckland."</p>

<p>"A word has been brought to me that the pakeha
has come to see the <i>nga iwi</i> (the tribes), and to bring
back to the man who rides at the head of the soldiers
and to the Mata Kawana the names of the men that
can be found for war in Rotorua."</p>

<p>"All untrue. This pakeha dislikes war, and only
fights when men insult him. He desires to return to
Auckland now that he has seen Te Terata, where he
will buy land from the Maoris&mdash;perhaps set up a
<i>whare-koko</i>."</p>

<p>"The pakeha's words are good, but who will say
that they are straight? He may return to Waitemata,
and tell the man who rides in front of the soldiers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>

with red clothes that the <i>pah</i> at Rotorua is old and
has rotten timbers, so that it would be easy for the
men with red coats and the men with blue ones to
take it. Why is the daughter of Mannering among
the women who are bearing burdens for the pakeha?
Will she follow him, and plant kumeras in his fields?"</p>

<p>"She will speak for herself," said Erena, stepping
forward with flashing eyes and scornful mien. "If
my father were here he would teach that evil-minded
man"&mdash;pointing to Ngarara&mdash;"to speak with respect
of his daughter. What can he say? Have I not a
right to walk in the same company as this pakeha, or
any other? Is not the daughter of a war-chief free to
choose her friends? Has not that always been the
law and the custom of the Arawa?"</p>

<p>Here there was a murmur of assent among the
spectators, particularly from the side where the women
of the tribe were assembled, while contemptuous looks
were directed at Ngarara, who stood with lowering
countenance, unable to face the withering scorn with
which the indignant maiden regarded him.</p>

<p>Here Warwick took up the argument, not unreasonably
considering that the just anger of the
girl might carry her beyond the limits of prudence,
as she stood, with burning eyes and heaving bosom,
ready to invoke the wrath of the gods upon the head
of the traitor who had dared to misinterpret her
motives. He pointed out that she had joined the
party with the express sanction of the great chief of
the Ngapuhi, whose written authority and safe conduct
she held; that the other natives, male and female,
had been hired for the expedition on liberal terms;
that they had been already paid in part (here he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>

pointed to certain articles of apparel and ornament
which they had lost no time in purchasing in Ohinemutu);
that Ngarara, also, who had proved ungrateful
and mischievous&mdash;"slave-like" and "a liar" were the
Maori terms&mdash;had benefited by the pakeha's liberality:
he had been paid in full. Here he named the sum,
and pointed to a new hat, which the disloyal one had
incautiously bought for himself. Upon him the eyes
of the whole assembly were at once turned, and his
countenance changed as a murmur of disapproval
arose. Finally, the pakeha had assured him that he
would send his friends from beyond the sea to see
the wonders of Te Terata and Rotorua; they would
bring trade and spend money like water for the benefit
of the Arawa and the Ngapuhi.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, using no mean quality of the
oratorical power which is a natural gift of the Maori
race, he produced Waka Nene's passport. This the
chief (fortunately one of those who, like that veteran,
had been taught to read and write by the early missionaries)
perused with attention, while the whole
tribe gazed with awe and reverence at the mysterious
paper&mdash;the written word; the magic scroll! How
often the herald of fate!</p>

<p>In this case, however, a triumphant success followed
the perusal of the few lines in the handwriting, and
signed with the name, of the great chief of the Ngapuhi,
who, with more than a thousand warriors at his back,
had formerly raided the Waikato and the Ngatimaru,
carrying war and devastation through the length of
the land.</p>

<p>"It is enough," he said, handing back the paper
to Warwick. "The pakeha is a great rangatira. He

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>

is the friend of Waka Nene, who sent Erena to show
him the great fountain and the hot breath of Ruapehu;
he is now the friend of Hika-iro and all the lake
tribes. As for you"&mdash;turning to Ngarara&mdash;"you are
a bad man, a <i>kuri</i>, a <i>tutæ</i>. Go!"</p>

<p>The discomfited Ngarara slunk away, pursued
by groans and hisses from the converted crowd, who,
as is usual in such cases, were more vehement in their
anger in proportion to the feeling of distrust which
had marked their first impressions.</p>

<p>Peace having been restored, and the enemy routed
with loss and dishonour, there remained no reason
why Massinger should not devote the few days
that remained to the exploration of this fascinating
province of the wonderland. Rarely did the weather
in that portion of the island remain steadfast to "set
fair" for so many successive days as in this halcyon
time.</p>

<p>Whether it was the excitement of the coming
strife, which he could see by the manner of Warwick
and Erena that they expected, the physical exhilaration
produced by the medicated atmosphere, the
association with the half-savage race, who now seemed
ready to bow down before him almost with adoration,&mdash;one
of these causes, or the whole combined, certainly
found him in a condition of spiritual exaltation such
as he had never before experienced, and in vain
essayed to comprehend.</p>

<p>"After all," he told himself, "it will be my last
holiday for months, possibly for years. I shall never,
perhaps, have such another ideal wandering through
a 'londe of faerye,' certainly never again have 'so
fair a spirit to be my minister.' A region of marvels

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

and magic, a tribe of simple children of nature, ready
to do my bidding! In this life of ours, so sad and
mysterious at times, such conditions cannot last; why,
then, should not one frankly accept a fragment of
Arcadia?"</p>

<p>He lost no time in communicating his change of
plan to Erena, whose features wore so radiant a smile
at the announcement that he saw in it the fullest
confirmation of the wisdom of his decision.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she said, "that you are going to
honour <em>my</em> country, <em>my</em> tribe, by your last visit among
them. I was born here, have swum and paddled in
the lake since I could walk; and though my father
changed our abode to Hokianga, and dwelt there
latterly, I have always loved Rotorua best in my
heart."</p>

<p>For the next few days they roamed over the lakes
and woods, the hills and dales, of this enchanted
ground in unfettered companionship and joyous converse.
They went in a canoe to Hinemoa's Isle,
rowed by two Maori girls, and beheld the bath which
bears her name to this day. They saw the beach on
which stood the doomed Arawas, confident in the
power of their hitherto inviolate wave. Here had they
fallen; here had the cannibal feast, with all its horrid
accompaniments, been held; here, where the grass grew
thick and wild flowers waved to the very margin of
the peaceful lake, had assailants and defenders waded
in blood amid the dead and the dying.</p>

<p>And yet now how calm, how peaceful, was the
historic water, how tranquil were all things, how
happily flowed on the village life! Who could have
believed that such horrors were transacted in this fairy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>

isle, where now the voices of children at play, the
crooning, low-voiced song of the girls, as they plaited
the flax mats or made with deft fingers the neat
provision-baskets, were the only sounds that met the
ear?</p>

<p>Together they climbed the rocky summit of the
island, and viewed the strangely compounded landscape,
heard the dire sounds as of groans and murmurings
of imprisoned fire-spirits, while from time to time an
impatient geyser in the haunted valley of Whakarewarewa
would fling itself in cloud and steam heavenwards
with wildest fury.</p>

<p>Together they stood before the curious stone image,
sacred under penalty of awful doom in the minds of
the simple people, as having been brought in an ancestral
canoe from the half-mythical Hawaiki in the
dim traditionary exodus of the race. Together they
forced their canoes up the glittering channel of
Hamurama, and held their hands in the ice-cold
fountain at its source, where it flows bubbling out of
the breast of the fern-clad hill.</p>

<p>The moon was slowly rising over the dark range
of Matawhaura as they left the further shore to return
to Ohinemutu. The air was delicious, the lake a
mirrored water-plain, across which the moonbeams
showed silver-gleaming pathways, as if leading to
other happy isles. The paddles of the Maori girls
dipped softly into the placid water as the canoe stole
silently across the lake's broad bosom.</p>

<p>"On such a night as this," said Massinger, "it
would be most appropriate for you to tell, and for
me to listen to, the legend of Hinemoa."</p>

<p>"It is a silly tale at best," answered Erena, with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>

a tone half of sadness, half of playfulness, in her
voice&mdash;"a tale of woman's love and man's fidelity.
They had better fortune in those old days."</p>

<p>"And, of course, nowadays," said Massinger, "there
can be almost no love and less fidelity."</p>

<p>"The pakeha is wrong," said one of the girls, as
they rested on their paddles, evidently anxious not
to miss Erena's version of the legend (like that of
Antar among the Arabs), ever new and deepening in
interest with every generation&mdash;"the pakeha is wrong;
girls' love is just the same as ever it was. It is
always fresh, like the foliage of the <i>pohutu kawa</i>, with
its beautiful red flowers. It does not fade and fall
off, like the leaves of the trees the pakeha brought to
the land."</p>

<p>"Hush, Torea!" said Erena; "you must not talk
so to this pakeha. He is a great rangatira. And
besides, you cannot know."</p>

<p>"Do I not?" answered the forest maiden. "If he
is a rangatira, he will know too. But are you going
to tell us the <i>Taihia</i>?"</p>

<p>"To stop your mouth, perhaps I had better; so
I will begin. You must know that there was a
young chief called Tutanekai, who resided with his
family on this island of Mokoia. He was handsome
and brave, but because of certain circumstances, and
being a younger son, he was neither of high rank nor
consideration in his tribe. He was, however, gifted
in various ways, which made the young women of the
tribe look favourably upon him. He was fond of
music. On account of this, he and his friend Tiki
constructed a stage or balcony on the slope of the
hill there, which he called Kaiweka. There they used

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>

to sit in the evenings, while Tutanekai played on a
trumpet and his friend upon a flute, the soft notes of
which were wafted across the lake to the village of
O-whata, where dwelt Hinemoa.</p>

<p>"Now, Hinemoa was the most beautiful maiden
in the tribe, and her reputation had travelled far. All
the young men had paid court to her, but could get
no mark or sign of favour. Among her admirers was
Tutanekai, but he was not certain of his feelings being
returned, and had not dared to pay her attention
openly. So he used, lover-like, to breathe his woes
into his melodious instrument; and night after night,
as he and his friend sat on their balcony, the tender
melancholy notes of the lover's trumpet floated over
the lake, and were audible amid the sighs of the
evening breeze and the plashing of the waves on the
shore.</p>

<p>"After many moons, and when the summer was
advanced, he found means to send a message to her
by a woman of her <i>hapu</i>, to whom Hinemoa answered,
'Have we both, then, had such thoughts of each
other?' And from that time she began to think
daily of the love which had sprung up in her heart
for Tutanekai, and to wander about by herself, and
refuse food and company, after the manner of lovesick
maidens. All her friends and relations began to
say, 'What has happened to Hinemoa&mdash;she who was
formerly so gay?' They also noticed that Tutanekai
shunned the company of the young men, save only
of his heart's brother, Tiki. Her feelings at length
became so uncontrollable, that if there had been a
canoe she would have paddled over to the point where
her lover's trumpet, like the voice of the sea Atua

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>

which none may disobey and live, seemed to draw her
very heartstrings towards his abode on Mokoia. But
her friends, thinking of this, had secured all the
canoes.</p>

<p>"So it happened that on one warm night, when
the moon was nearly full, she resolved in her heart
what to do. She tied together six empty gourds to
float around her, lest she might become faint before
she reached the island, and softly slid into the lake
near this very point, Wai-rerekai, which we are now
approaching, and as often as she felt tired she floated
with the help of the gourds. At last, when nearly
exhausted, she reached the rock near the warm spring,
which is still known by her name. Here she bathed
and rested, also warmed herself, as she was trembling
all over, partly from cold, and partly at the thought
of meeting Tutanekai.</p>

<p>"While the maiden was thus warming herself in
the hot spring, Tutanekai felt thirsty, and sent a slave
to bring him water. So this slave went to the lake
close to where Hinemoa was, and dipped in a calabash.
The maiden, being frightened, called out to him in
a gruff voice like a man's, 'Who is that water for?'
He replied, 'It is for Tutanekai.' 'Give it to me,
then,' said Hinemoa. Having finished drinking, she
purposely threw down the calabash and broke it.
The slave went back, and told Tutanekai that a man
in the bath had broken it. This occurred more than
once. Then Tutanekai in a rage went down to the
bath, and searching about, caught hold of a hand.
'Who is this?' said he. 'It is I, Hinemoa.' So
they were married, and lived happily," said Erena,
concluding rather abruptly. "Oh, the next trouble

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>

which occurred was that Tiki, the friend of Tutanekai's
heart, grew ill and like to die because he had no wife,
after being deprived of his friend and heart's brother.
However, he was consoled with the hand of Tupe,
the young sister of Tutanekai, and all was joy and
peace."</p>

<p>At this happy ending the two Maori girls clapped
their hands and shouted, "<i>Kapai, Kapai!</i>" till the
lake-shore echoed again. Then dashing in their
paddles, they rowed with such power and pace that
they were soon landed at the legendary point of rock
whence Hinemoa, love-guided, tempted the night, the
darkness, and the unknown deeps.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The allotted days passed all too quickly. They
had wandered through the forest aisles and silent
over-arching glades of Tikitapu; had stood on the
saffron-hued flooring of Sulphur Point; had revelled
in the life-renewing waters of the "Rachel" and the
"Priest's" hot springs, whence all who bathe in faith
issue cured of earthly ailments. The Oil Bath, the
Blue Bath, the Spout Bath were successively tested,
until, as it seemed to Massinger, he had acquired a
new skin, almost a new soul and body, so exalted
seemed every motion of sense and spirit.</p>

<p>At Whakarewarewa the great Pohutu Geyser, with
its eruptive column of steam and water, nearly eighty
feet in height, had been visited; also the grim and
terrible Brain Pot, unknowing of the tragedy of which
it was to be the scene, concluding with the dread and
noisome Dantean valley redolent of the sights and
sounds of the Inferno, even Tikitere.</p>

<p>But one more day remained, and the trio were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>

engaged in debate as to the manner in which it
should be spent, so as to compress the greatest possible
enjoyment into the "grudging hours," when a party
of natives was observed to come through the fern-covered
flat between Whakarewarewa and the lake,
and at once proceed to the carved house. Here a
number of the tribe, including the chief and certain
elders, at once assembled.</p>

<p>"News of importance," said Warwick. "Something
is in the wind; I must go over and see."</p>

<p>There was no doubting the fact that highly important
intelligence had been received. The whole
tribe was astir, and buzzing like a swarm of angry
bees. When Warwick returned his face was grave
and anxious.</p>

<p>"As I feared," he said. "The Governor has been
obstinate in the wrong place; he would not give way
in the case of the Waitara block. Blood has been
shed. The Waikato tribes are massing their men,
and threaten to attack Taranaki. <em>War is declared.</em>
Outlying settlers have been killed. There is no going
back now."</p>

<p>"This looks serious indeed," said Massinger, not,
however, without a certain alertness of manner which
showed that the romance of war was uppermost
in his mind. "What is to be done? or where must
we go?"</p>

<p>"It has come at last; I was certain that it would,"
said Erena. "What a terrible thing it is that men
should be so foolish, so selfish! But we must do
something, and not talk about it. I am for making
across to Hokianga, and must go and prepare at
once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her idea is a good one," said Warwick, as the
girl ran down to her end of the camp and called up
her women. "We can get over to Horaki and go
down the river by boat. The neighbourhood will be
quiet as yet. We can trust the Ngapuhi, with Waka
Nene to keep them steady, to be loyal to England.
He never wavered in Heke's war, and is not likely
to do so now. We must take leave of this chief,
and get away without loss of time. But who comes
now&mdash;with a following, too? This looks like a
<i>taua</i>."</p>

<p>Here a fresh excitement arose, while shouts of
"<i>Haere mai!</i>" and other words of welcome, more
strongly emphasized than usual, denoted the arrival
of a personage of importance. A comparatively large
body of men, well armed, and superior to the ordinary
natives of the district in height and warlike appearance,
had come in sight. They marched regularly,
and as they came up, all carrying muskets and
cartridge-pouches, they presented a highly effective
and martial appearance. Their leader was a white
man.</p>

<p>At this moment Erena, who had been busied with
her female attendants, reappeared. The moment she
caught sight of the contingent she uttered a cry of joy,
and, turning to Massinger, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is indeed most fortunate. We shall have no
more trouble about routes. Yonder is my father. Let
us go to meet him."</p>

<p>As she spoke Massinger noticed that the leader
of the party, after a few words of greeting to the
chief, had turned in their direction, and commenced
to walk slowly towards them. As they approached

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>

one another, Erena seemed anxious to explain to him
the fact of her father's appearance at Rotorua at this
particular time.</p>

<p>"He has, no doubt, had news of the likelihood of
war, and has been to some portion of the tribe at a
distance on some message for Waka Nene. He ranks
as a war chief in the tribe since the old war, and has
much influence."</p>

<p>By the time the explanation was concluded they
were almost face to face, and Massinger was enabled
to note the appearance and bearing of Allister
Mannering, perhaps the most remarkable man
among the by no means inconsiderable number of
distinguished persons who from time to time had
elected to cast in their lot with the children of
Maui.</p>

<p>Massinger, in later years, always asserted that never
in his whole life had he been so much impressed by
the personality of any living man as by the remarkable
individual who now stood before him. Tall
beyond the ordinary stature of manhood, but of
matchless symmetry, and moulded not less for activity
than strength, there was a compelling air of command
in his eye which every motion confirmed. His expression
was grave and stern, but as he approached
Erena, who ran to meet him, a wave of tenderness
crossed his features like the ripple on a slumbering
sea. Then he folded his daughter in his arms with
every token of paternal fondness.</p>

<p>Whatever somewhat belated explanation of the
position Massinger was arranging in his mind, was
arrested by the meeting between father and child.
After a short colloquy Mr. Mannering advanced, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>

with perfect courtesy expressed his pleasure in welcoming
him to Rotorua.</p>

<p>"I see that Erena has, with the help of Warwick
here, done her part in showing you some of our
wonders. Like her historic ancestress, she has a
strong will of her own, but had I not the most
thorough confidence in her prudence, as well as in the
honour of an English gentleman, you will acknowledge
that I might have cause for disapproval."</p>

<p>Here his steady, searching gaze was fixed full upon
Massinger, who felt how poor a chance an unworthy
adventurer would have, standing thus before him. But
he met his accost frankly.</p>

<p>"I am indeed gratified to have met you, Mr.
Mannering," he made answer. "I owe much of the
charm of this month's travel and adventure to your
daughter's companionship. It will be a lifelong
memory, I assure you."</p>

<p>"You are neither of you to say any more about
it," interposed Erena, with a playful air of command,
hanging on her father's arm and menacing Massinger.
"I am sure <em>I</em> enjoyed myself very much; so we are
all pleased,&mdash;which ends that part of the story. But
oh! father, is it true that the war has commenced? If
so, what are we to do, and how is Mr. Massinger to
get back to Auckland? I thought of going straight
to Hokianga."</p>

<p>"Exactly what we are to do, not later than tomorrow
morning. That is, I am going, you are going,
also my <i>taua</i>, whose only prayer is to fall in with
some of the Waikatos, not more than double their
number, and have a good old-fashioned bloodthirsty
battle. They are all men who have grown up since

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>

Heke's war, and are spoiling for a fight. As for this
gentleman's and Warwick's movements, they can settle
them independently. I suggest that they avail themselves
of my escort to Hokianga, whence they can
easily find a passage to Auckland."</p>

<p>"Nothing could suit my purpose better," said
Massinger. "I shall feel honoured by your company.
Warwick will probably return with me."</p>

<p>Here the guide nodded assent.</p>

<p>"That is settled. You will find a hearty welcome
from our chief, who has returned. I am proud to
call him my earliest and best friend. So, as you are
interested in Maori life and customs, you will never
have a better opportunity of studying them under
their natural conditions&mdash;I mean in time of war."</p>

<p>"In the land and the people I take an interest so
deep that it will fade only with my life. Deeds, however,
are more in my line, and by them I trust
to be judged."</p>

<p>"There is a time coming for all of us," said Mr.
Mannering, gravely, "when the valour and wisdom of
both races will be put to the test. I have no doubt
of the first. I only hope that the second may not be
found wanting in the day of trial. And now, if you
will excuse me, I must go back and hold diplomatic
palaver with Hiki-aro, the chief here, and his most
potent, grave, and reverend seigneurs. My men will
be off duty, and will amuse themselves with games&mdash;most
probably a war-dance, which you may like
to see."</p>

<p>"I have seen one already in Auckland, but I will
look on."</p>

<p>"And I will <em>not</em>," said Erena. "It is an abominable

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

heathen custom, making these ignorant natives worse
than they are, and recalling the bad old times
which every one should be ashamed to speak about.
I shall pack up and get ready for an early start."</p>

<p>"You won't change 'Tangata Maori' just yet, my
dear Erena," said Mannering. "This war will throw
him back a few years. But I agree with you that
these old customs should be suffered to die out, and
as we shall have ample time to discuss the war on
the road home, I will reserve mention of it till tomorrow."</p>

<p>So saying, he departed to his <i>taua</i>, who, not
until he dismissed them, piled their muskets, over
which, in despite of their friendly relations with
Rotorua, they set an adequate guard. They were
soon observed to join their compatriots in a copious
and hospitable meal provided by the women of the
tribe.</p>

<p>"How relieved I am!" said Warwick, when father
and daughter had departed on their respective errands.
"Nothing could have been more fortunate than
meeting Mr. Mannering here. Even in travelling to
Hokianga, a friendly route, we might have met a
skirmishing <i>taua</i> like his own, and, in spite of Waka
Nene's passport, would have stood but little show of
escaping. Maori blood has been shed, as well as
white, and any murder of stray Europeans or hostile
natives would be justifiable, according to inter-tribal
law."</p>

<p>"Then we are safe as far as Hokianga?"</p>

<p>"I should say perfectly so. Mr. Mannering is a
tower of strength; no single <i>taua</i> dares tackle his.
His bodyguard are picked men, known to be equal

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>

to almost double their number. Then, of course, he
has the whole Ngapuhi tribe, five thousand strong, at
his back."</p>

<p>"And when we get to this Hokianga, as it is
called? Is it a township?"</p>

<p>"It's a noble river, miles wide near the sea, with
towns and villages on it. In the grand forests of
Kauri Totara and other pine woods within reach, a
great timber trade has flourished for many years
past. Sailing-vessels ply between Horaki, Rawini,
and Auckland, so there will be no difficulty in getting
back."</p>

<p>The ceremonies proper to leave-taking having been
transacted, the reinforced party set out for the
Hokianga, through what are mostly described as
pathless woods interspersed with morasses.</p>

<p>When the march was less difficult, and there was
leisure for conversation, Mannering beguiled the way
with tales and reminiscences which caused Massinger
to wonder unceasingly that a man so variously gifted,
possessed of such social charm, so wide an experience
of men and books, should have elected to wear out
his life amid a barbaric race. "Doubtless," thought
he, "this man belongs to the true Viking breed, a
born leader of men, impatient of the restraints of
civilization, not to be contented without the quickening
presence of danger, 'the dust of desperate battle,' the
savour of blood, even. Such men have always been
thrown off, from time to time, by our sea-roving race;
have nobly done their parts in subduing for the empire
the waste places of the earth. His hair is tinged with
grey, but how springy his long elastic strides, how
youthful are all his movements, how joyous his laugh,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>

how keen his sense of humour! An <i>Anax andr&#333;n</i>&mdash;a
king of men, without doubt. No wonder that his
daughter should have inherited, along with her glorious
physical perfection, which she owes in part to her
mother's race, the higher intelligence and lofty ideals
which ennoble 'the heirs of all the ages, and the
foremost files of Time!'"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">"You</span> can inform me, then," said Massinger, "as to
the exact manner in which the war commenced."</p>

<p>"I fancy I can. This Waitara block which you
have heard about has been the <i>causa belli</i>, in every
sense of the word. The Governor, egged on by the
Provincial Council of Auckland and the land-buying
party in the General Assembly, at length consented
to purchase it from Teira."</p>

<p>"I was told in Auckland that the Governor said
if a satisfactory title could be given, he would accept
the offer which Teira made. That seemed fair
enough."</p>

<p>"Nothing less so. First of all, because Teira knew&mdash;no
one better&mdash;that no living native had a right to
sell an area of tribal land. There are always scores
of claimants to such blocks, the consent of all of
whom was necessary. And after and above all this,
Te Rangitake, as the Ariki (High Priest and spiritual
head) of the tribe, had an unquestioned right to
forbid the sale."</p>

<p>"How, then, did Teira come to sell the land?"</p>

<p>"Because he was certain of payment of so much
ready money down, and had an old grudge against

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>

Te Rangitake. With the Government behind him,
he argued, they would be able to force through
the bargain. He either did not count on the stubborn
resistance of the tribe, or, more likely, did not
care.</p>

<p>"He seems to have acted treacherously to his
own people and dishonestly towards us."</p>

<p>"Precisely. But no people on earth are more
reckless of consequences than these. Still, Colonel
Browne was distinctly wrong in accepting a disputed
title. His former opinion, from which he unluckily
receded, was (as he wrote to Lord Caernarvon),
'That the immediate consequences of any attempt
to acquire Maori lands without previously extinguishing
the native title to the satisfaction of all having
an interest in them would be a universal outbreak, in
which many innocent Europeans would perish, and
colonization be indefinitely retarded.' Of course, the
Europeans coveted these lands, and were determined
to get them by hook or by crook."</p>

<p>"Then what would you have advised?"</p>

<p>"The mischief is done now. The rebellion must
be put down or the tribes pacified. No easy task,
as you will see. Still, a public trial and full examination
of the title of Teira would have satisfied
Rangitake and the tribes. Teira's title was <i>bad</i>, as
every Maori in the island knows, and every Englishman
must confess, who is not interested in land or
politics."</p>

<p>"But a war would have been certain to come at
some time between the races."</p>

<p>"Possibly; but it should not have been entered
upon to bolster up a wrong and an injustice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will it spread, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I fully believe that it will. The Waikatos will
join, unless I am misinformed&mdash;a powerful tribe, well
armed, and with numbers of young men who have
not been able to indulge in tribal fighting lately, and
are naturally eager for battle."</p>

<p>"Are they, then, so devoted to war? This tribe
has been exceptionally prosperous, I have heard."</p>

<p>"All the more reason. They have 'waxed fat,'
etc., and long to try conclusions with the white man.
As for liking war as an amusement, read the record
of the last century. It is one long list of stubborn
and bloody engagements&mdash;wars for conquest; wars
in satisfaction of long-past feuds; wars in defence;
wars of aggression; wars for ill-timed pleasantries; for
all conceivable reasons; last, not least, for no reason
at all. Of the Maoris it may be said most truly, as
Sir Walter Scott of the borderer&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">'Let nobles fight for fame;</span>
      <span class="i1">Let vassals follow where they lead.</span>

      <span class="i1">But <i>war's</i> the Borderer's game.'</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So most truly is it the Maori's. Next to the
chance of killing his enemy, the chance of being killed
himself is the most delightful excitement known to
him. So, you may judge that a force of this character,
used to gliding through woods like these, unhampered
by clothing, yet well armed, must be a dangerous
foe."</p>

<p>"So I should think," said Massinger. "And if
these Waikatos join the Ngatiawa and other tribes,
they will have a considerable force? What, for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>

instance, is about the number of adult whites in this
North Island?"</p>

<p>"In 1849 about six thousand, including nearly half
as many soldiers; and of natives, say one hundred
and five thousand."</p>

<p>"Then if they choose to combine, they could drive
us into the sea."</p>

<p>"If a really well-organized attack by the whole
Maori nation was made before the Government could
get help from abroad, the whites would be something
in the same position as they were in Hayti when
the negroes revolted. But it will never come off."</p>

<p>"Why should it not?"</p>

<p>"Because, as in the Great Indian Mutiny, the
tribes are divided. Some of the older chiefs, men of
ability and forecast, have always been true to the
whites, and will remain so&mdash;Waka Nene and Patuone,
with others. Their tribes are powerful, and are, like
most savage races, ready to join the whites against
their hereditary enemies&mdash;such, by many a bitter
blood-feud, that time has not weakened."</p>

<p>"I understood from your daughter&mdash;you will
pardon me for referring to it&mdash;that you had personally
assisted the British Government in the time of Heke's
rebellion."</p>

<p>"Yes; I was the first and only white man who
raised men, and held him and his force in check
after he had sacked and burned the town of Kororareka.
We were fighting almost every day for a month till
the troops arrived. When I proposed to the chief,
Waka Nene, to oppose Heke, he said he had not
men enough, but that if I would join him with all I
could raise, he would turn out. I saw that the fate

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>

of the North depended on my answer; Heke was then
on the march to Hokianga. I agreed. In twenty-four
hours I had joined the chief, with twice as many
men as he had, and, as I said before, we found the
enemy in full employment till the troops came."</p>

<p>"What a glorious opportunity! And yet it is not
every one who could have taken prompt advantage
of it. I should have been delighted to have been
in it."</p>

<p>Mannering looked with approval at the animated
countenance of the speaker as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Waka Nene and I would have been only too glad
to recruit you and a few more of the same stamp.
It was very good fun while it lasted. My friend
Waterton came on as soon as he could get across
from Hokianga, and was in the thick of it. His
right-hand man was shot dead within a foot of him."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Though ordinarily reserved, Massinger, when
abroad, made a point of conversing with strangers of
all callings and both sexes, in an unstudied fashion,
which often produced unexpected gains.</p>

<p>He was wont to tell himself that this careless
comradeship was like turning over the leaves of a
new book. For is not the mind of any human
creature, could one but catch sight of certain
cabalistic characters, traced deep in the tablets of
the inner soul, more exciting, more amazing, more
comic, more terrible, more instructive than any book
that ever left printer's hands? Yet never, at home
or abroad, had he encountered a companion like to
this one. A wonderful admixture of the heroic and
social attributes! The reckless courage of a Berserker;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

the air of born command which showed itself in
every instinctive motion; the love of danger for its
own sake, as yet unslaked by time, by dangerous
adventures over land and sea; the iron constitution
which could endure, even enjoy, the privations of
savage life, joined to an intellect of the highest order;
speculative, daring, fully instructed in the latest
results of science and sociology, yet capable of
presenting every subject upon which he touched in
a new and original light; while around the most
grave issues and important questions played a vein
of humour, comic or cynical, but irresistibly attractive.</p>

<p>Massinger had heard of such personages, but had
assuredly never met one in the flesh before. What
might such a man not have become, with the favouring
conditions which encircle some men's lives? A
great general, an admiral, for he was equally at
home on land or sea; a prime minister; an explorer;
a pastoral magnate in the wide areas and
desolate waste kingdoms of Australia, where a
thousand square miles wave with luxuriant vegetation
during one year, and in the second following are
dust and ashes! To any eminence in the wide
realms of Greater Britain might he not have ascended,
surrounded by staunch friends and devoted admirers,
had he chosen to select a career and follow it up
with the unflinching determination for which he was
proverbial! And, thought this Englishman, what
had he done? what was he? A leader of men,
certainly&mdash;a chief in a savage tribe in a scarce known
island, at the very end of the world, content to live
and die far from the centres of civilization, the home
of his race, the refinements of art, and intellectual

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>

contact with his peers. What an existence, what an
end, for one who had doubtless started in life with
high hopes of success and distinction in the full
acceptation of the word, of honourable command
and acknowledged eminence!</p>

<p>And what had been the clog upon the wheel, the
fateful temptation, the enthralling lure potent to sway
so strong, so swift a champion from the path sacred
to his race, leaving him towards the close of life
among shallows and quicksands? What, indeed?
mused he, looking up. And, even as he turned,
Erena, fresh from an exploration to the fords of a
flooded stream which barred their path, presented
a living answer to the query. As she stood in the
uncertain light which struggled through the forest
glades, her eyes bright with triumph and her form
transfigured with the momentary gleam of the sun-rays,
he could have imagined her a naiad of old
Arcadian days, prompt to warn the hero of the
approach of danger. Such must have been her
mother in the springtime of her beauty, in the year
when her father, a youthful Ulysses, appeared as a
god newly arisen from the sea before the Nausicaa
of the tribe. It was not given to man to resist the
o'ermastering spell of such a maiden's love. "The
oracle has spoken," he thought. "Is it a warning,
or the knell of fate?"</p>

<p>"I have found the bridge," she said, her clear tones
ringing out through the silent woods, joyous with
girlish triumph. "It was made in the old wars, but
is still strong. Westward lies the Hokianga."</p>

<p>She led the way by a well-worn path which turned
at an angle from the ordinary track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is the bridge!" she said at length, pausing
at the bank of a rushing stream, which, swollen by
rain in the mountain ranges, had in twenty-four hours
risen many feet above the ordinary ford. "It is old,
as you can see, but strong and unbroken still. Over
this passed the great tribe of the Ngatimaru when
they were fleeing with their women and children in
Hougi's time. I could almost fancy that I see traces
of blood on these great beams still. But it will serve
us as well as it served them. And now we have but
to cross these wooded hills and we are at Maru-noki,
my father's home. I welcome you to it in
advance."</p>

<p>Here they were joined by Mr. Mannering and
Warwick, who had been talking earnestly for some
time, probably about the war, and the more pressing
and now inevitable consequences.</p>

<p>"I could wish that you had made your appearance
last year," said the former, "when I could have acted
as cicerone with leisure and effect. After being a
foe to hurry and bustle all my life, I think it most
unkind of fate to let me in for what I plainly foresee
will be a period of disturbance most unsatisfactory to
all concerned."</p>

<p>"There is nothing which I should have enjoyed
so much," replied Massinger; "but you will agree
with me that this is no time for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dilettante</i> work. I
shall always be thankful for the experience I have
had so far, with its unfading memories."</p>

<p>"And may I ask what you propose to do when
you reach Auckland?"</p>

<p>"They were talking of raising a volunteer corps
when I left, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have already raised one," interposed Mannering.
"More than that, the militia have been called
out, and proclamation of martial law made. Te Rangitake's
pah was burnt on the 6th; the boundaries of
the Waitara block were surveyed the week after under
military protection. Te Rangitake built another pah
on the disputed land, and pulled up the surveyors'
pegs. On the 17th, Colonel Gold attacked the pah
with howitzers, after sending a note by Parris, which
the Maoris refused to read. They returned fire, and
wounded three men. Next morning a breach was
made, by which the troops entered, to find the pah
empty. They were two days destroying a fortification
put up in one night, and garrisoned by seventy
Maoris!"</p>

<p>"A bad start, surely?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as tending to give the tribes confidence in
their ability to fight white troops&mdash;a dangerous lesson,
as the Governor and his advisers will find out."</p>

<p>"Has further fighting followed?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, yes. Two pahs have been built
at Omata, and three settlers killed south of Taranaki.
Te Rangitaka, to do him justice, warned his men not
to make war on unarmed people. A combined force
of militia volunteers, soldiers, and sailors stormed the
pah at Omatu. So it is a very pretty quarrel as it
stands."</p>

<p>"You have heard this 'from a sure hand,' as they
used to say before post-offices were invented?"</p>

<p>"My tidings are only too true, I am sorry to say.
And, in spite of the success of the troops, my opinion
is that the war has only commenced. If the Waikato
tribes join, others will be drawn in. It will take years

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>

to subdue them thoroughly&mdash;years of vast expenditure
of blood and treasure."</p>

<p>"Speaking from your experience of both sides,
what would you suggest as an alternative policy?"</p>

<p>"Withdrawing from Waitara promptly. Justice
would be done, and a lasting peace might be secured.
The Maoris are now the Queen's subjects, and should
be treated as such. Just now each side has secured
a temporary advantage. With a consistent and
impartial policy, disaffection would cease. By-and-by
the natives will sell their land readily enough; with
a minimum price established by the Crown and proper
titles decided by a Land Court, all things would find
their level. No one will object except land speculators
and their allies."</p>

<p>"Would not the Government act even now upon
your representations?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. I am afraid that I am in the position
of Wisdom crying in the streets. But, to quit 'the
arts of war and peace,' wildly exciting as the subject
is becoming, here is Maru-noki, our lodge in the
wilderness, to which I beg to welcome you heartily."</p>

<p>They had been pursuing a winding woodland path,
which at last conducted them to an eminence below
which the view, opening out, disclosed a noble river.
Immediately below where they stood, and near a rude
but massive wharf, was a cottage, built bungalow-fashion,
with broad verandahs, surrounded by a
palisaded garden, and shaded by those typically
British trees, the "oak, the ash, and the bonny elm
tree." Leafy memorials of the fatherland, they are
rarely absent from the humblest cottage, the lordliest
mansion, in Britain's colonies, and in none do they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>

flourish more luxuriantly than in these isles of the
farthest South.</p>

<p>The present home of the Hokianga tribe was on
the lower levels, which, since the cessation of the
chronic warfare which desolated each district from
time to time, they had adopted as more convenient.
None the less, however, on a lofty hill-top within
easy reach was the primeval fortress, to which for
generations they had been wont nightly to repair for
security, and from which issued to their daily duties
the long trains of chiefs, warriors, women, and slaves.
On the opposite bank of the river were low hills and
dunes of drifted sand, while to the eastward rose two
promontories, cloud-like in the misty azure, between
which rose and fell the tides of the unbounded main.</p>

<p>Warwick and Erena had gone forward to the
cottage, whence a hospitable smoke presently ascended.
Willing handmaids from the kainga were also in
evidence. No time was wasted. The keen air, the
day's march, all tended to superior appetites. In half
an hour after Massinger had been refreshed with a
glass of excellent Hollands, and inducted into a
bedroom, furnished chiefly with books, he found
himself in the dining-room before a luncheon-table
exceedingly well appointed. The fish and game, with
vegetables and corned pork, were truly excellent. The
bread was extemporized, but, in the shape of hot
griddle cakes, was only too appetizing. Tea, of
course, concluded the repast, than which, Massinger
confessed, he never remembered enjoying one more
heartily.</p>

<p>"In an hour or so," said Mr. Mannering, "we will
stroll down to the kainga. The head chief of our

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>

tribe, the celebrated Waka Nene, whom you met on
your way over to the Terraces, has returned. You
will hear what he says on the present state of things.
No man in the island can speak with more knowledge
or authority. Warwick and I have a few arrangements
to make; meanwhile I dare say you can find something
to interest you among my old books. Erena
will keep you company till I return."</p>

<p>Massinger found ample <i>pabulum mentis</i> among the
varied collection of books and papers, which not only
filled the shelves around three sides of the room, but
won place on the mantelpiece, the window-sills, and,
indeed, on the floor. Old colonial works of the earliest
days of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia, the
worn binding of which denoted their archaic value,
jostled the latest scientific treatises or recently issued
biographies and travels, besides magazines and illustrated
papers up to date.</p>

<p>"Here," thought he, "is another factor in the
so-called solitary, self-exiled life of this truly remarkable
man&mdash;'never less lonely than when alone,' with
these companions of every age and all time at his
elbow. What a delicious place to read in! I can fancy
him on this couch, with his pipe and a favourite author,
when the day is declining, or beneath those o'er-shadowing
ferns on the hillside, spending hours in a
state of absolute beatitude. The open window 'gives'
on the broad river, 'strong without rage, without
o'erflowing full,' an occasional sail fleeting by like a
returning sea-bird. Canoes are racing home after a
day's fishing, the girls paddling for their lives, and
encouraging one another in the mimic contest with
laughing reproaches and warlike cries. The <i>dolce</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>

<i>far niente</i> period to be succeeded by a pedestrian
expedition at the head of his faithful retainers, or a
yacht voyage to Auckland, where congenial companionship
at the Club and the news of the civilized world
await him. How peacefully, how happily, might life
flow on under such conditions! How long might slow
o'ertaking age defer his approach! The only thing
wanting to complete this ideal existence, for a man of
his temperament, is the excitement of war; and this
he is about to have."</p>

<p>The catalogue of pleasures open to a quasi-hermit
of such various tastes and accomplishments was interrupted
by the entrance of Erena, who had apparently
completed her household arrangements, and was
minded to add the charms of her society to his mental
indulgences.</p>

<p>"It is easy to see that I have been away," she
said. "When the fit takes him, my father surrounds
himself with books, which he never puts back, and
reads day and night for weeks together. He is absent-minded,
and careless of the proprieties to a wonderful
degree, so that I have a month's work generally in
putting him and the household to rights when I return
from a visit or an excursion."</p>

<p>"And do you often go so far from home as when
I met you first?" he said. "I suppose you are not
afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid?" she said, with a look of surprise and
scorn. "Of what, or of whom? In time of peace
who is there to harm me? When you saw me I had
been to see a cousin. She sometimes comes here to
stay with me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry not to have met her. Why didn't

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>

you introduce me? Is she of the same charming
complexion as yourself&mdash;that clear brunette tint which
I admire so much?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed merrily. "Do you indeed? The
truth is, she was rather shy. She is a 'full Maori,' as
we say, though she talks good English, and is thought
very good-looking. I would have brought her up, but
she went away the morning after. Her family sent
for her in a hurry. But I see my father coming up
to take you to the chief, Waka Nene."</p>

<p>"The great chief of whom I have heard so much;
I hardly noticed him before. Now tell me about him.
What is his general disposition?"</p>

<p>"He is a man who would have made a great field-marshal
in any other country. Very calm&mdash;generally,
that is&mdash;looking always to the future; slow in making
up his mind, never changing it afterwards. He decided
many years ago that the religion of England and her
laws were those for him and his tribe to adopt, and in
war or peace he has never swerved from that policy."</p>

<p>"You said something about his being calm nearly
always? Is he sometimes the contrary?"</p>

<p>"He is usually most dignified; but he can be terrible
when really aroused. It is an old story now, but he
once shot a native dead before his own friends and
relations because he had helped to kill a white man
treacherously."</p>

<p>"Indeed, that was judicial severity in earnest.
How did it come about?"</p>

<p>"In this way. The natives at Whakatane first of
all 'cut out' and burned a vessel called the <i>Haws</i>,
or <i>Haweis</i>, killing part of the crew. They were
headed by a chief called Ngarara, or 'the reptile'&mdash;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>

not so very unlike his namesake, our friend. He,
however, was shot by a Ngapuhi chief from the deck
of the <i>New Zealander</i>, a vessel sent from the Bay of
Islands, to make an example of him. The tribe went
to Hicks Bay, and, taking the pah there, at Wharekahika,
captured two Europeans; one they killed, the
other was rescued by a passing ship. A Ngapuhi
native took part in the murder; he was then visiting
at Whakatane, but lived with his wife at Tauranga.
Waka Nene was on the beach at Maungatapu when
this native returned. He advanced towards him and
delivered a speech, <i>taki</i>-ing, or pacing up and down,
Maori-fashion, while the other natives sat around.
'Oh,' he said, 'you're a pretty fellow to call yourself
a Ngapuhi! Do they murder pakehas in that manner?
What makes you steal away to kill pakehas? Had
the pakeha done you any harm, that you killed him?
There! that is for your work,' he said, as he suddenly
stopped short and shot the native dead, in the midst
of his friends. It was bold and rash, but all New
Zealand knew him then and long after as the friend
of the pakehas."</p>

<p>"That was true Jedwood justice, which used to
be described as 'hang first and try afterwards,' but
from his point of view it was the just vengeance of
the law."</p>

<p>"It seemed cruel," said Erena, who had told with
flashing eye and heightened colour this tale of the
"wrath of a king." "But little was thought of the
poor white man killed by a stranger to the tribe for an
act with which he had nothing to do, and perhaps had
never heard of. What the Ngapuhi suffered for was,
that if he had belonged to Ngarara's tribe his act

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>

would have been justified, as <i>utu</i> (proper vengeance).
It was for mixing himself up with the blood-feud of
another tribe that Waka Nene killed him; and his
people saw the justice of it, and did not interfere."</p>

<p>Mr. Mannering, arriving at the end of the story,
announced two facts, one of which was that the chief
would be ready to receive them in half an hour; the
other, that a timber-laden schooner would leave the
wharf on the following afternoon, and no doubt would
be happy to give Mr. Massinger and Warwick a
passage to Auckland.</p>

<p>"Of course, we should be too happy to put you
up for as long as you cared to stay with us; but,
from what I hear, things are going from bad to worse
at Taranaki. The natives have scored what they
consider a success so far, and are confident that they
can hold their own against the regulars. More troops
have been sent for, also artillery. Nothing less than
a campaign will satisfy either side now."</p>

<p>"If it were an ordinary time nothing would give
me greater pleasure, I can say most sincerely," said
Massinger. "I could fish and sail, ride and walk,
and even take a turn at that mysterious industry of
gum-digging, of which I hear exciting reports. But
as things are, I feel in honour bound to report myself
at headquarters. I am not wholly inexperienced in
military matters, if a yeomanry captain's commission
counts for anything."</p>

<p>"You will find that it has a solid value at present,"
said Mannering. "The colonists are so keen, that any
one who has ever heard a bugle-call is looked upon
as a veteran."</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," laughed Erena. "We shall look in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>

the papers for what happens when Major Massinger
goes to the front. Only, remember our bush rambles,
and don't despise the poor natives because they have
no uniform. Keep a good look-out among the tree-ferns
and the manuka; there will be the danger."</p>

<p>Upon which Erena, who seemed quite as much
inclined for tears as for laughter, retreated to her own
dominions.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The great chief of the Ngapuhi stood near the carved
porch of the <i>wharepuni</i>, surrounded by the elders of
the tribe. He was dressed in his garments of ceremony,
having a fine flaxen mat, worn toga-fashion,
across his breast. In his hair were the rare feathers
of the beautiful <i>huia</i> which none save a chief may
wear. His staff was in his hand, which he shifted to
the left as he extended his right hand in friendly
greeting to the pakeha.</p>

<p>"My word to you is again welcome," he said,
fixing his calm, inexpressive, but steadfast eyes upon
the young man's face. "My pakeha friend Mannering
tells me that you depart to Waitemata. It is well.
My heart is sore because of the foolishness of the
Mata Kawana. The <i>runanga</i> of the pakeha also is
obdurate."</p>

<p>"The war has begun," said Mannering. "It seems
a small matter, but this land at Waitara will be dearly
bought."</p>

<p>"A little fire will burn the forest when the fern is
dry," replied the chief, gravely. "Money was given
to Teira for Waitara, but blood must be paid. The
chain of the surveyor is now red."</p>

<p>"Will not Te Rangitake listen to Wiremu Thompson

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

and to Tamati Ngapora?" said Mr. Mannering. "Their
word is not for war. Trade is better than fighting,
better than too much land."</p>

<p>"He would listen, perhaps, but the people of the
tribe will not. Then there is the King business
to bring more trouble. If the Waikato join the
Ngatihaua, it will be such a war as we have not seen
yet."</p>

<p>"And the Ngapuhi?" asked Massinger, almost
wondering at his own temerity.</p>

<p>"The Ngapuhi," replied the chief, with stately
dignity, "fought for the English through the war of
Honi-Heke; they fought with the Rarawas against
the Ngati maniapoto and the Waikato. They will do
so now. You have the writing of Waka Nene?"</p>

<p>He produced the paper.</p>

<p>A grave smile overspread the tattooed countenance
as he spoke rapidly for some minutes in the native
tongue to Mr. Mannering, who replied in the same
language; then, saluting both in a farewell manner, he
departed towards the spot where a concourse of natives
of both sexes stood or sat amid the whares of the
kainga.</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?" inquired Massinger.
"Did it relate to me in any way?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was only that it would be a good thing
for you to keep that bit of paper. No one could tell
now what was going to happen. He thought it well
that you should leave in the timber vessel. I am of
the same opinion, or we should not let you go just
yet, I promise you."</p>

<p>Then they strolled homewards. The declining
sun was lighting up the green meadows, in which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>

women were working in the kumera patches; the broad
reach of the river, on which canoes were gliding
smoothly in the half light; the grim pah, with its
palisades and trenches, looking down upon the peaceful
scene which, to all appearance, was fixed in Arcadian
serenity. Was it fated to resound with the war-cries
of hostile tribes in the coming campaign? Was the
tomahawk, the club, the musket, of a ruthless foe to
work war's worst horrors upon this simple industrious
community of nature's children?</p>

<p>The evening which Massinger spent at this "kingdom
by the sea" would always, he told himself, be marked
with a white stone in his calendar. Nothing could
have exceeded the geniality of the atmosphere. The
dinner was excellent of its kind, while the saddle of
home-grown, black-faced mutton, precursor of the
astounding shipments which have afforded of late
years such cheap and plentiful repasts to the British
working man, reminded the ex-squire of his home
flock. Mr. Mannering produced claret of a choice
vintage, the finest which the guest had met with in
New Zealand. Tales of wild life and strange company
were contributed by the host and Warwick, replete
with thrilling interest, as hairbreadth escapes or hand-to-hand
fights were described. Erena's gay laugh or
sportive disclaimer were not wanting, while Massinger
took care to play the part of a discreet listener, less
anxious to speak than to absorb the rare and unfamiliar
knowledge which only such men as Mannering and
their guide were capable of imparting.</p>

<p>It was arranged that in the following morning
Erena should accompany him to the pah which the
stranger was most anxious to see&mdash;the far-famed tribal

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>

fortress, the unconquered Whiria, which every traveller
since the days of Cook had lauded for its exhibition
of engineering skill.</p>

<p>"You will have full time," said Mr. Mannering,
"as the schooner does not leave until late in the
afternoon, and will probably anchor at Rawene to
take in Kauri gum. If so, I trust you will be able to
make acquaintance with my old friend and comrade,
Waterton, who is the King of the Lower Hokianga. I
will say nothing more than that you will find him 'a
picked man of countries,' and as such, with other
qualities, a very treasure-house of knowledge. He
has not so long returned from an extended European
tour, so that he is well up to date in the old world
and the new."</p>

<p>Our hero thought to himself that surely no other
country contained so many notable personages, rich
in the courtier's, scholar's, soldier's eye, tongue, sword,
as this astonishing island, in which the human marvels
were not less numerous and unique than those of
nature. But he said merely that he trusted in his
luck to provide him with a head wind, in which case
he would be delighted to avail himself of Mr. Waterton's
hospitality.</p>

<p>"It is such a pretty house, and quite a wonderful
garden," chimed in Erena. "I think they have every
tree in Australia there, besides our poor ratas and
karakas. However, you will see for yourself; only
don't tell the Miss Watertons what a pilgrimage we
have done together, or there will be murder next time
we meet."</p>

<p>"I shall be most discreet, I assure you; but I am
afraid I shall break down in the cross-examination.
What a pity you will not be there to defend me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to go very much; but there will be
no more visiting for me for some time to come, unless
the tribe moves away. But if we can't tell what is
before us in time of peace, in war it will be even
more uncertain. And now I must say good-night if
we are to walk to the pah tomorrow and the track
is chiefly uphill."</p>

<p>Warwick strolled down to the village, bent upon
ascertaining the popular feeling on the subject of the
war, and Mannering, having lighted his pipe and
opened a fresh bottle of claret, invited his guest to
take the comfortable armchair on the opposite side of
the glowing wood fire, and "launched out into a wide
sea of reasoning eloquence."</p>

<p>His guest was not anxious to retire early, though
having a fair amount of exercise to his credit. He
was one of those lucky people who are capable of
deferring sleep to a more convenient season if any
specially exciting affair be on hand. Reflecting that
he might never have the opportunity of enjoying such
another symposium, or meeting so many-sided an
entertainer, he resigned himself frankly to the occasion.
The bottle of claret was finished, and perhaps another
or two opened, the second of the small hours was
near its close, when the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i> was concluded, and
Massinger retired for the night, well pleased with
himself as having had good value for a protracted
<i>sederunt</i>.</p>

<p>Hour after hour had he listened to the charmed converse
of this extraordinary personage. Much had he
seen, much read, deeply thought, in solitude revolving
the social and scientific problems of all ages, bending
a vigorous and original mind to the solution of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>

dread mysteries of life and death, with much solemn
questioning of the Sphinx regarding the Here and the
Hereafter. He could imagine him travelling onward
through the dread solitudes of the Antarctic pole,
sledge-borne, like the creation of Frankenstein, or
turbaned and robed as an Arab, urging a camel
through the arid wastes of the Western deserts. Of
all inhabited lands south of the equator, his knowledge
was complete and accurate, and in every clime or
condition of life the guest could well believe that
the analytical, all-comprehensive, unresting intelligence
was testing scientific results or garnering knowledge.
And yet, <i>Cui bono</i>? What contributions to the use
and enjoyment of mankind could such a protagonist,
in every contest between man and nature, have
furnished? Would he bequeath such a treasure to
posterity, or would his wisdom die with him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> hours of soundest sleep sufficed for the guest's
present needs. Looking through his casement, he
beheld the sun just clearing the tops of the pines ere
he summoned this secluded world to its occupations.
Early as was the hour, Mannering was already dressed,
and strolling through the garden with his matutinal
pipe. The kainga was alive and busy; women hurrying
to and fro, preparing the food for the day; children
clustering around in expectation; the young people
bathing in the river or launching their canoes. The
hovering flock of sea-birds showed where a shoal of
<i>kakahai</i>, at which they dashed from time to time,
ruffled the surface of the water or leaped above it.
All nature was responding to the day-god's summons,
as a warmer glow suffused the sky and tipped the
crown of the frowning dark-hued pah with gold. Massinger
betook himself to the jetty at the foot of the
garden, and, plunging into the clear cool depths, felt
refreshed and strengthened for whatever the coming
day might provide, returning after a lengthened swim
just in time to dress for breakfast.</p>

<p>"I thought that you and my father would never
leave off talking last night," said Erena, as she came

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>

into the hall, looking as fresh as the morn, which she
not inappropriately typified. "You did not disturb
me, for I slept soundly for hours, and when I awoke,
thinking it was near morning, I heard your voices,
or rather my father's."</p>

<p>"I am not certain that I should have gone to bed
at all if he had not suggested it," said Massinger. "I
never had such a glorious night."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so. It is such a treat
to him to have a visit from any one who knows about
books and the world, that he cannot find it in his heart
to leave off. When Mr. Waterton pays us a visit, they
talk all day and all night nearly."</p>

<p>"What is that you're saying?" called out the man
referred to from the garden. "Who is taking away
my character? I have no better answer than a paraphrase
of Charles Lamb's: 'If I go to bed late, I
always get up early.' There will be plenty of time
to sleep when there is nothing better to do; that is,
if Te Rangitake and his Waikato friends will let us
enjoy ourselves in our own way, which I begin to
doubt. In the mean time, let us take short views of
life. So you two young people are going to look at
the pah?"</p>

<p>"With your permission. I should like to examine
it well. The knowledge may come in useful by-and-by.
Who knows? When was the last attack made
upon it?"</p>

<p>"Twice in Heke's war, more than twenty years
ago. I was younger then, and had the honour of
being one of the defence force. We beat off the
besiegers with loss."</p>

<p>"I suppose firearms were used?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly. Every tribe was well provided at that
time. They bought them dearly, too, as the chiefs
compelled them to work so fearfully hard at the flax-dressing&mdash;<i>Phormium
tenax</i> being the purchase-money
for muskets&mdash;that many died of the unhealthy conditions,
marshy levels, and crowded whares in which
they lived. However, there was nothing else for it.
The tribe which first became armed proceeded at once
to crush its nearest neighbour or enemy, as the case
might be."</p>

<p>"So it was a case of life and death?"</p>

<p>"Nothing short of it," said Mannering. "The first
use which Hongi Ika made of his civilizing visit to
England, where he 'stood before kings,' was to grasp
the immense significance of the gunpowder invention,
and make bad resolutions, to be carried out when he
should return to his own country. With characteristic
Maori reticence, he kept his own counsel when staying
with the worthy pioneer missionary, Marsden, at his
house in Parramatta, where Admiral King often met
him, and was much struck with his dignified and
aristocratic carriage. By the way, it was the admiral's
father, Governor King, who took the trouble to return
to their own country two deported Maoris from Norfolk
Island, where they were languishing in exile,
having been carried there with some idea of teaching
the art of flax-dressing. This, of course, they could
not do."</p>

<p>"Why? Did they not know?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. They were chiefs, and as such
incapable of menial labour."</p>

<p>The weather being favourable to the expedition
to the pah, Roland Massinger and his fair guide set

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>

out with that sanguine expectation of pleasure which
the exploration of the unknown in congenial company
excites in early youth. The path lay across the
cultivated plots of the tribe, where he noticed the
neatness and freedom from weeds which everywhere
prevailed. The plantations were chiefly on an alluvial
flat, through which a creek ran its winding course. It
had been swollen by recent rains, so, encountering a
small party of women and children carrying baskets,
Erena inquired in the vernacular as to the best place
to cross. A pleasant-looking woman asked, apparently,
who the pakeha was, and after receiving Erena's reply,
in which Massinger detected the word "rangatira,"
laughed as she made a jesting reply, and volunteered
to guide them. This she did by leading the way to
the side of a boundary fence; from this she extemporized
a bridge, which, though narrow, answered the
purpose. The pakeha gave a shilling to a bright-eyed
elf running beside her, the sudden lighting up of
whose face told that the value of coin of the realm
was not unknown even in this Arcadian spot.</p>

<p>"What did the woman say?" he asked, as they
went on their way towards the steep ascent.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes sparkled with merriment, as she
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"She wished to know who you were, and when
I said a pakeha rangatira, her reply was, 'Oh, quite
true; he looks like one.' They are keen observers,
you see, and very conservative. It would astonish
you to see how quickly they find out the different
rank and standing of the white people they meet."</p>

<p>"They have no modern craze for equality or
socialistic rule?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"None whatever. A chief is born to his exalted
rank, which is undisputed. At the same time, he
must keep up to a certain standard in war or peace,
otherwise his <i>mana</i>, his general reputation and influence,
would suffer."</p>

<p>"And a slave?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"Oh, a slave is forced to work at the pleasure of
his owner, and may be killed for any reason or none
at all. So also the common people of the tribe must
obey the chiefs, more particularly in war, though, like
those of other nations, they can make their voices
heard at critical times."</p>

<p>"And the women?" queried Massinger.</p>

<p>"Oh, the women!" said Erena, while a graver
expression overspread her face. "I am afraid that
they have to work hard, and are not so much considered
as they might be. They do most of the
cultivation, mat-making, cooking, and general household
duties, particularly when grown old. The younger
ones have a better time of it."</p>

<p>"So they have everywhere. It is the prerogative
of the sex. It only shows that human nature is
much the same everywhere, and that all societies
differ less in the essentials of life than is generally
supposed."</p>

<p>Having skirted the river-shore, a part of which
was of the nature of quicksand, and so needed a
guide to the manner born, they began to ascend the
slope of the volcanic hill, which, as throughout the
North Island, had been selected for the tribal castrum.
After a lengthened climb, which would have tested
the powers of less practised pedestrians, they stood
upon the wind-swept summit, artificially levelled, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>

through the heavy sliding gates entered the ancient
fortress. Before doing so they had to cross trenches,
to scale embankments, and had time to note the
various strategic preparations which, though crumbling
or partially dismantled, exhibited the skill with which
they had been constructed. The water-supply, as in
most of the "castles" of the period, was the weak point,
the besieged having to steal out in the night at the
peril of their lives to procure the indispensable element.</p>

<p>"What a glorious view!" exclaimed he, as, side
by side, they looked on the wide expanse of land and
sea which lay beneath and around them&mdash;the broad
estuary, the broken and fantastic outlines of the
mountain range beyond the river-bank.</p>

<p>The surf was breaking on the bar between the
heads of the Hokianga, while southward lay the valley,
studded with the whares of the kainga and the garden-like
plots of the kumera fields. Almost unchanged
was the scene since the rude warrior, standing on
stages behind these palisades, launched his spear at
the foe, or, wounded in the assault, looked his last
upon mountain and valley, sea and shore, but died
shouting defiance.</p>

<p>"What a strange thing is this life of ours!" said
Massinger, musingly. "It is less than a year since I
was living contentedly in an English county, on an
estate which my forefathers had held for centuries. I
had then no more idea of quitting England than I
have of setting out for the planet Mars."</p>

<p>"And do you not regret the leaving such a paradise
as England is said to be, when one is born to
wealth and honour?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I do. So far from it, that I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>

consider I have made a distinct advance in knowledge
and development. My life then was narrow and
monotonous, leading to nothing save contentment
with a round of provincial duties."</p>

<p>"But travel, high companionship, ambition, the
Parliament of England,&mdash;noble-sounding words! What
boundless fields of enjoyment and exertion! Were
not these enough to fill your heart?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. But all suddenly my life lost its savour;
hope died, ambition vanished; existence revealed
itself merely as a pilgrimage through a desert waste,
haunted by lost illusions, and strewed with withered
garlands. For a while I thought to end it, but a convalescent
stage succeeded. I arranged my affairs and
sold my place, resolved to seek a cure for my soul's
unrest beyond the narrow bounds of Britain."</p>

<p>"Sold your ancestral home! How <em>could</em> you do
such a thing? And what possible reason could you
have had for such a mad step, as I have no doubt
your friends called it?"</p>

<p>"That was the exact word they used. But I had
made my choice. All things habitual and familiar
had become distasteful&mdash;finally insupportable. I chose
this colony as the most distant and interesting of
England's possessions; and here I am, an exile and a
wanderer in a new world, but"&mdash;turning to Erena&mdash;"honoured
with the friendship of the best of guides
and most charming of comrades."</p>

<p>She heard almost as one not hearing; then,
suddenly fixing her eyes, bright with sudden fire,
upon his countenance, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I be told the reason of this breaking away
from all you held dear? You said I was a comrade,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>

and, believe me, no man ever had a truer. Was
it a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A woman? Of course it was a woman. When
is man's life eternally blessed or cursed except by a
woman? When is he hindered, injured, ruined, and
undone by any event that has not a woman in it?"</p>

<p>"And she was beautiful, clever, high-born?"</p>

<p>"All that and more; I had never met with her
equal. She was an acknowledged queen of society.
She had but one fault."</p>

<p>"She did not love you?" said the girl, hastily,
while her tones vibrated with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Not sufficiently to link her fate with mine for the
journey from which there is no retreat. She admitted
approval, liking, respect&mdash;words by which women disguise
indifference; but she believed that she had a
mission in life, a call from heaven to go forth to the
poor and afflicted, to elevate the race&mdash;a sacred task,
for which marriage would unfit her."</p>

<p>"You pakehas are strange people," she said
musingly. "And so she would not be happy because
she desired to teach, to help the poor, the <i>common
people</i>! And if she failed?"</p>

<p>"She would have wasted her own life, and ruined
that of another."</p>

<p>"Life is often like that, so the books say&mdash;even
the Bible. 'Vanity of vanities!' Either people do not
get what they want, or find that it is not what they
hoped for. Yet I suppose some people are happy&mdash;generally
those who know the least. Listen to that
girl singing. She is, if any one ever was."</p>

<p>They had been descending the hill, when at an
angle of the narrow path they came upon a young

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>

native woman, sitting at the door of a cottage which
bore traces of European construction. A child stood
at her knee, while she was busied about her simple
task of needlework. The midday sun had warmed,
not oppressed, the atmosphere, and there was an air
of sensuous, natural enjoyment about her air and
appearance as she looked over the river meadows
where the tribe was employed. Her face lighted up
with a smile of recognition as she saw Erena and her
companion.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Hira. Where is Henare? You
are all alone here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is at some road-work," she answered
cheerfully, "but he always comes home at night. He
gets good wages from the contractor."</p>

<p>"What a nice cottage you have!&mdash;weather-boarded,
too. Who built it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Henare and another half-caste chap sawed
the boards and put it up. He likes living here better
than in the kainga, and so do I. We can go down
there when we want to."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, then. I have been showing this
pakeha gentleman the pah.&mdash;Now, those people are
just sufficiently educated to be happy and contented,"
said Erena. "He is a steady, hard-working fellow,
and, as roads are beginning to be made, he is able
from his pay to build a cottage and live comfortably."</p>

<p>"Education is a problem. If it leads people to
think correctly on the great questions of life, it is&mdash;it
must be&mdash;an advantage; but if, through anything
in their condition, it produces envy and discontent,
it is an evil, with which the nations have to reckon
in the future."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sometimes wish I had not been educated
myself," she said with a sigh. "I seem to have all
manner of tastes and hopes most unlikely to be
realized. Whereas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And just at that moment the lilt of the girl on
the hillside came down to them, joyous with the
magic tones of youthful love and hope. It furnished
an answer to her questioning of fate, immediately
apparent to both.</p>

<p>"Do not doubt for an instant!" exclaimed Massinger,
touched to the heart by the girl's saddened
look, and realizing the justice of her complaint.
"<i>You</i> were never born for such a life. Nature has
gifted you with the qualities which women have
longed for in all ages. Your day will come&mdash;a
day of appreciation, fortune, happiness. Who can
doubt it that looks on you, that knows you as
I do?"</p>

<p>In despite of her boding fears and the melancholy
which so often depressed her, she was not proof
against this confident prediction. Her youth's hey-day
and nature's joyous anticipation protested alike
against a passing despondency.</p>

<p>"It may be as you say. Let me hope so. Do
not the bright sun, the blue sky, the dancing waves,
all speak of happiness? And yet, and yet&mdash;&mdash;But
here comes your schooner, rounding the point. Our
time of friendship is over. I wonder when we shall
meet again?"</p>

<p>"When indeed?" thought her companion. But,
determined in his heart that this should not be his
last interview with this fascinating creature, so subtly
compounded of the classic beauties of the wood-nymph

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>

and the refinements of modern culture, he answered
confidently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before the year is out, surely. This war, if so it
may be called, must only be a matter of months,
perhaps weeks. The tribes, after a skirmish or two,
can never be mad enough to defy the power of
England. I must make a Christmas visit to Hokianga,
if indeed we do not meet in Auckland before
the spring is over, at the ratification of peace. There
are sure to be festivities to celebrate the event, and
you must dance with me at the Government House
ball."</p>

<p>"Without shoes and stockings?" she said laughingly&mdash;"though
I dare say I could manage them and
the other articles. But we must not deceive ourselves.
Months, even years, may not see the end of
the war. May we both be living then, and may <i>you</i>
be happy, whatever may be the fate of poor Erena!"</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>That trim little craft, the <i>Pippi</i>, tight and seaworthy,
was anchored near the wharf when they
returned. Certain cargo, chiefly kauri gum and
potatoes, had to be taken in, and the passengers
were informed that towards sundown her voyage
would be resumed. No time was lost, therefore, after
lunch in sending their luggage on board, strictly
limited as it had been to the requirements of the
march. Warwick, who as paymaster had been giving
gratuities to the native attendants who had come on
from Rotorua, reported that they were more than
satisfied, and would not forget the liberality of the
pakeha. They would take the chance of returning
to their <i>hapu</i>, where they had first been met with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is as well to leave friends behind us," he
said. "There will be all kinds of bush-fighting for
volunteers such as you and I may be, and native
allies often give warning when white ones would be
useless. They may counteract that scoundrel Ngarara,
who will do us a bad turn yet if he can."</p>

<p>"By the way, what became of him at Rotorua?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he cleared out. The kainga became too
hot to hold him after the chief's dismissal. He will
join some party of outlaws. They will be common
enough when real business begins."</p>

<p>The chief walked up with Mannering from the
kainga, and joined the party at lunch in order to say
farewell. Massinger was much impressed with the
calm dignity and courteous manner of this antipodean
noble. Apparently unconscious of any incongruity
between his national surroundings and those of his
entertainers, he might have posed as a British kinglet
during a truce between the Iceni and the world's
masters.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine dined with the Reverend Mr.
Marsden at Parramatta in 1814," said the host, "where
he met Hongi Ika with his nephew Ruatara. That
historical personage had recently returned from
England, where he had been, if not the guest of a
king, favoured with an audience, and in other ways
enjoyed social advantages. My friend said none of
the swells of the day could have conducted themselves
with greater propriety or shown a more impassive
manner."</p>

<p>"All the time Hongi had blood in his heart. He
deceived the good Mikonaree," said the chief. "His
thought was to destroy Hinaki and his tribe, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>

Ngatimaru, as soon as he could buy muskets. Yet
he did not take Hinaki by surprise, for he told him
to prepare for war, even in Sydney. Then Totara
fell, and a thousand Ngatimaru were killed. But the
times are changed. The Queen is now our Ariki;
for her we will fight, even if the Waikato tribes join
Te Rangitake. The Ngapuhi and the Rarawa have
taught the Waikato some lessons before. They may
do so again."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>With a fair wind, light but sufficient to fill the
sails of the <i>Pippi</i>, they swept down the river, which,
increasing in volume near the heads, showed an
estuary more than two miles in width. Not far from
where the breakers proclaimed the presence of a bar,
and opposite a point of land historically famous for
tribal orgies, stood the ancient settlement of Waihononi.
A substantial pier, available for reasonably large crafts,
also a store and hotel, showed the proverbial enterprise
of the roving Englishman. Fronting the beach stood
Mr. Waterton's dwelling, a handsome two-storied
mansion, surrounded by a garden which, even while
passing, Massinger could note was spacious and
thronged with the trees of many lands. An orchard
on the side nearest the ocean was evidently fruitful,
as the vine-trellises and the autumn-tinted leaves of
the pears and apples showed. An efficient shelter had
thus been provided against the sea-winds and the
encroachment of the sand-dunes. These had been
planted with binding grasses, including the valuable
"marram" exotic, so wonderful a preventative of drift.
Ability to protect as well as to form this outpost
was not wanting, as evidenced by the presence of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>

half a dozen nine-pounders, which showed their
noses through the otherwise pacific-appearing garden
palisades.</p>

<p>Owing to certain mercantile arrangements, the
departure of the <i>Pippi</i> was delayed for a day; a
consignment of Kauri gum had not arrived. This
was too valuable an item of freight to be dispensed
with; and the Rawene dates of sailing not being so
rigidly exact as those of the P. and O. and Messageries
Maritimes, the detention was frankly allowed.
Time was not of such extreme value on the Hokianga
as in some trading ports. Mr. Waterton expressed
himself charmed with the opportunity thus afforded
of entertaining any friend of Mannering's. Massinger
was equally gratified with the happy accident which
permitted him to meet another of New Zealand's
distinguished pioneers. So, general satisfaction being
attained&mdash;rare as is such a result in this world of accidental
meetings and fated wayfarings&mdash;a season of
unalloyed enjoyment, precious in proportion to its
brevity, opened out unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I should have been awfully disgusted," was
his reflection, as he found himself inducted into a
handsome upper chamber, from the windows of
which he beheld a wide and picturesque prospect,
the foaming harbour bar, and the aroused ocean
billows, "if I had lost this opportunity. The delay in
land-travelling might have been serious, but, as the
Maoris are not yet a sea-power, a day's passage more
or less cannot signify." So, having dressed with
whatever improvement of style his limited wardrobe
permitted, he allowed the question of the sailing of the
<i>Pippi</i> to remain in abeyance, and joined his host below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Of that most interesting and delightful visit, it
would be difficult to describe adequately the varied
pleasures which thronged the waking hours. Lulled
to sleep by the surges, which ceased not with
rhythmic resonance the long night through; awaking
to seek the river-strand, where the white-winged
clustering sea-birds hardly regarded him as an
intruder; the well-appointed and compendious library
in which to range at will; the walks; the rides
through forest and vale; the fishing expeditions, in
one of which Massinger, proud in the triumph of
having hooked a thirty-pound schnapper, discerned
the snout of a dog-fish uprising from the wave.
Then the evenings, prolonged far into the night,
with tale and argument, raciest reminiscences of lands
and seas from his all-accomplished host&mdash;<i>quarum
pars magna fuit</i>&mdash;author, painter, sailor, explorer;
such truly Arabian Nights' Entertainments Massinger
had never revelled in before, and never expected to
enjoy again.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Auckland once more! The traveller, though now
a confirmed roamer, was, for obvious reasons, by no
means grieved to find himself again in the haunts of
civilized man. He had been interested, instructed,
illuminated, as he told himself, by this sojourn in
woodlands wild. Face to face with Nature, untrammelled
by art, he had seen her children in peace, in
love and friendship. He was now, as all things
portended, about to obtain a closer knowledge of
them in war&mdash;a rare and privileged experience,
unknown to the ordinary individual. How grateful
should he be for the opportunity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>His first care was to possess himself of his letters
and papers. There were not many of the former,
still fewer of the latter. The county paper gave
the usual information, as to poachers fined or imprisoned,
a boy sent to gaol for stealing turnips.
The hunting season had been fortunate. More
visitors than usual. The riding of Mr. Lexington,
son of the new owner of Massinger Court, had been
much admired. That gentleman had exhibited
judgment as well as nerve and horsemanship in (as
they were informed) his first season's hunting in
England. His shooting, too, was exceptional, and
a brilliant career was predicted for him with the
North Herefordshire hounds. A few epistles came
from club friends and relatives. They were of the
sort written more or less as a duty to the expatriated
Briton, but which rarely survive the second
year. The writers seemed much in doubt as to his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">locale</i>, and uncertain whether New Zealand was one
of the South Sea Islands or part of Australia. They
all wished him good luck, and foretold future prosperity
as a farmer, which was the only successful
occupation out there (they were told) except digging
for gold, which was agreed to be uncertain, if not
dangerous. They concluded with a strong wish that
he would come back a quasi-millionaire before he became
a confirmed backwoodsman. And he was on no
account to marry a "colonial" girl, when there were so
many charming, <em>educated</em> damsels at home. This last
from a lady cousin, who had with difficulty restrained
herself from imparting the last South African news,
as being apposite to his situation and circumstances.</p>

<p>These despatches were put down with an impatient

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>

exclamation, after which he sat gazing from the window
of his hotel, which afforded a fine view of the harbour.
Then he took up a letter in a hardly feminine hand,
which he had placed somewhat apart, as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne bouche</i>
for the latter end of the collection. This turned out
to be from his candid and free-spoken friend, Mrs.
Merivale, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Branksome&mdash;a matter which he had
probably divined as soon as he glanced at the rounded
characters and decided expression of the handwriting.</p>

<p>Opening it with an air of pleasurable expectation,
and observing with satisfaction a couple of well-filled
sheets, he read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir Roland</span>,</p>

<p>"Now that I am safely married and all
that, I may make use of your Christian name, with
the affectionate adjective, I suppose. The adverb
in the first line was part of the congratulation of my
great-aunt, who evidently thought that any girl with
a decent amount of go in her, who did not habitually
confine herself to phrases out of Mrs. Hannah More's
works and read the <cite>Young Lady's Companion</cite>, was
likely to end up with marrying an actor or an artist,
whose useful and more or less ornamental professions
she regarded as being much of a muchness with
those of a music or dancing master.</p>

<p>"Well, one of the advantages of my present 'safe'
and dignified position is that I can have friends, even
if they happen to be young men, and give them
advice. This I used to do before, as you know,
though as it were under protest. 'This is all very
fine,' I can hear you say, 'but why can't she leave off
writing about herself, and tell me about&mdash;about

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>

&mdash;why, of course, Hypatia Tollemache. Is she "safely"
married (hateful word!), gone into a sisterhood, started
for Northern India to explore the Zenanas, and teach
the unwilling "lights of the harems" what they can't
understand, and wouldn't want if they did?' None of
these things have happened as yet, though they are
all on the cards. She tried 'slumming' for a time,
but her health broke down, and she had a bad time
with scarlet fever. I made her come and stay with
me after she was convalescent, and oh, how deadly
white and weak she was!&mdash;she that was such a tennis
crack, and could walk like a gamekeeper. I tried
with delicacy and tact (for which, you know, I was
always famous!) to draw her about your chances&mdash;say
in five years or so. But she would not rise. Said,
'people were not sent into the world to enjoy
themselves selfishly,' or some such bosh; that she
had her appointed work, and as long as God gave
her strength she would expend what poor gifts He
had endowed her with, or die at her post; that in
contrast with the benefits to thousands of our suffering
fellow-creatures which one earnest worker might
produce, how small and mean seemed the conventional
marriage, with its margin narrowed to household
cares, a husband and children! Were there not whole
continents of our poor, deprived not only of decent
food, raiment, lodging, by the merciless Juggernaut
of inherited social injustice, but of the knowledge
which every adult of a civilized community should
enjoy without cost? And should any man or woman,
to whom God has granted a luxurious portion of the
blessings of life, stand by and refuse aid, the aid of
time and personal gifts, to save these perishing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>

multitudes? When a girl begins to talk in this
way, we know how it will end. In the uniform of a
hospital nurse; in a premature funeral; in marriage
with a philanthropist, half fanatic, half adventurer: what
Harry calls a 'worm' of some sort&mdash;the sort of parasite
that preys upon good-looking or talented women.</p>

<p>"Dear me! as my aunt says, I am getting quite
flowery and didactic. Isn't that something in the
teaching or preaching line? I forget which. Harry
says I am a journalist spoilt. I don't know about
that, but I <em>should</em> like to be a war correspondent. I
am afraid there is no opening for a young woman
in that line yet&mdash;a young woman who isn't clever
enough to be a governess, loathes nursing, would
assassinate her employer if she was a lady help, but
who can walk, ride, drive, play tennis, and shoot fairly.
By the way, there's going to be a war in the South Island,
isn't it? Couldn't you contrive to be badly wounded?
and perhaps&mdash;only perhaps&mdash;she, 'the fair, the chaste,
the inexpressive she,' might come out to nurse you.</p>

<p>"Harry says <em>that's</em> a certain cure for&mdash;let me see&mdash;indecision,
the malady of the century as regards
young women. I remember being troubled with it
myself once. He says I was&mdash;whereas now&mdash;but I
won't inflict my happiness upon you.</p>

<p>"What a long letter, to be sure! Never mind the
nonsense part of it. That is partly to make you laugh.
He advises you, in the elegant language of the day,
to 'keep up your pecker,' which he says means <em>nil
desperandum</em>. I say ditto to Harry, and ask you to
believe me, <em>always</em>,</p>

<p class="right">"Your sincere friend,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Merivale</span>."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Massinger put down the letter of his frank and
kindly correspondent with feelings of a mixed nature,
akin to pleasure, as evidencing an interest in his
welfare not all conventional, but, on the other hand,
recalling regrets exquisitely painful. These being
partially dulled, he had mistakenly concluded that
they had no further power to wound. And now, after
a comparative cure, when his tastes had been satisfied
and his curiosity aroused by the incessant marvels of
a fantastic region, he had been recalled to the old
land, resonant with the past anguish. The inhabitants
of this enchanted isle, with their mingled pride and
generosity, chivalrous courage and ferocious cruelty,
had aroused his sympathies. There, beyond all, stood
the figure of Erena, with her frank, half-childish ways,
her countenance at one time irradiated with the joyous
abandon of an innocent Bacchante, as she laughed
aloud while threading with him the forest paths; at
another time with shadowed face and downcast mien,
when a presage of future ills caused the light to fade
out of her luminous eyes.</p>

<p>The free forest life, with its daily recurrence of
adventure and excitement, had sufficed for all the
needs of his changed existence. And now, even by
the hand of a friend, were the seeds of unrest sown.
He thought of Hypatia Tollemache stricken down in
the pride of her mental and bodily vigour, laid low in
the conflict in which she had so rashly, so wastefully,
risked her magnificent endowments. Had he been in
the neighbourhood of Massinger, to cheer, to comfort,
to gently question her plan of life, to offer to share
it with her, to urge his suit with all the adventitious
aid of predilection and propinquity, what success,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>

unhoped for, indescribable, might he not then have
gained?</p>

<p>At this stage of his reflections he collected his
correspondence, and, locking them up in his long-disused
travelling portfolio, went forth into the town.
Here he was confronted with the world's news, and
details of this, the latest of Britain's little wars, in
particular. First of all he betook himself to the offices
of the New Zealand Land Company, where his first
colonial acquaintance and fellow-passenger, Mr. Dudley
Slyde, might be found.</p>

<p>That gentleman was, happily, in, but his arduous
duties as secretary and dispenser of reports seemed
for the moment in abeyance. He was engaged in
packing a sort of knapsack to contain as many of the
indispensable necessaries of a man of fashion, and
apparently a man of war, as could be adjusted to an
unusual limitation of space. A rifle stood in the corner
of the apartment; a revolver of the newest construction
then attainable lay on a table; the smallest modicum
of writing materials was observable; and, neatly folded
on a chair, was a serviceable military uniform.</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you, old fellow," said Mr. Slyde.
"Sit down. Try this tobacco: given up cigars for the
present&mdash;don't carry well. Suppose you've taken to a
pipe, too, since you've begun your Maori career? Got
back alive, I see. Didn't join the tribe, eh? Report
to that effect. Girl at Rotorua, fascinating, very."</p>

<p>This suggestive compendium of his life and times
caused a smile.</p>

<p>"You're as near the truth as rumour generally is,"
he said; "but I wonder that people concern themselves
with the doings of this humble individual."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"New country, you know. Great dearth of social
intelligence since the war. Tired of that, naturally.
Free press, you know; say anything, confound them!"</p>

<p>"Another chapter in the book of colonial experience,
which I shall learn by degrees. But what am
I to understand by these warlike preparations?"</p>

<p>"You see before you a full private in the Forest
Rangers. Must join something, you know. Situation
serious. More murders. Waikato said to be joining.
Taranaki settlers afraid of sack and pillage. Troops
and men-of-war sent for. In the mean time, the devil
to pay. What shall <em>you</em> do? Go back to England?
I would, if I wasn't a poor devil of a Company's clerk
and what you call it."</p>

<p>Massinger stood up, and looked at the lounging
figure fixedly for a moment, until he saw a smile
gradually making its way over the calm features of
his companion.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," he said, as if answering an
apparent protest. "Only my chaff. What will you
join? Town volunteers? militia? <em>Ours</em> rather more
aristocratic; trifle more danger, perhaps. Corps of the
Guides, and so on. Von Tempsky's Forest Rangers!
Splendid fellow, Von&mdash;Paladin of the Middle Ages.
Seen service, too. Son of a Prussian general, I
believe. Commission in 3rd Fusiliers in '44. Cut
that, and travelled through Central America. Commanded
irregular Indian regiment. Piloted officers of
<i>Alarm</i> and <i>Vixen</i> in affair of the Spanish stockades
at Castilla Viojo. Been in front everywhere, from
Bluefields Bay to Bourke and Wills' Expedition in
Australia, when he refused to be second in command.
Man and regiment suit you all to pieces."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just the man I should choose to serve under.
Where can I be sworn in, and when?"</p>

<p>"All right; I'll show you. Leave for the front, day
after tomorrow. Jolly glad to have you, believe me."</p>

<p>This important ceremony being performed in due
course, Massinger betook himself to the office of Mr.
Lochiel, where he expected to receive fuller information
as to the state of the country, and the prospects
of a general rising. He was received by that gentleman
with warmth and sincerity of welcome.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said he, "I am delighted to
see you safe back. Macdonald and I were most
anxious about you. We knew that you must pass
through Maori country, and in the present disturbed
state of the island there was no saying what might
have happened to you, or indeed to any solitary
Englishman. I hear that you returned by sea."</p>

<p>"I was advised to do so by Mr. Mannering at
Hokianga, with whom I stayed for a few days."</p>

<p>"Best thing you could have done, and no one was
more capable of giving you advice. He is judge and
law-giver among the Ngapuhi, and a war chief besides.
A truly remarkable man. I suppose you saw his handsome
daughter? Wonderful girl, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"She certainly did surprise me. It seems strange
that she can consent to lead a life so lonely, so
removed from the civilization which she is so fitted
to appreciate."</p>

<p>"And adorn likewise. We are all very fond of
her here. But she is passionately attached to her
father, and nothing would induce her to leave him.
Have you heard the latest war news? Came in by
special messenger this afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed. I am only generally aware that
matters are going from bad to worse; that the militia
and volunteers are called out; also the Forest Rangers,
in which band of heroes I have just enrolled myself.
Dudley Slyde and I will be companions in arms."</p>

<p>"Slyde! Dudley Slyde? Very cool hand; rather
a dandy, people say. All the more likely to fight when
he's put to it. He knows the country well, too. There
is no doubt in my mind that every white man in the
North Island who can carry arms will have to turn
out."</p>

<p>"And how long do you think the war will last?
Six months?"</p>

<p>"I should not like to say six years, but it will be
nearer that than the time you mention. Maclean
thinks five thousand troops will be required if the
neighbouring tribes join Te Rangitake. Richmond
is of the same opinion. Three Europeans have been
shot on the Omata block. It was to avenge these
that the volunteers and militia turned out, when the
men of H.M.S. <i>Niger</i> behaved so splendidly; the
volunteers also held their own."</p>

<p>"Is there any further demonstration?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a great <i>hui</i>, or meeting, has been held at
Ngarua-wahia, on the Waikato. They say that three
thousand Maoris were present, who were all on the
side of Te Rangitake. Fifty of his tribe were there,
asking for help."</p>

<p>"And what was the outcome of it all?"</p>

<p>"They were agreed in one thing&mdash;that the
Governor was too hasty in fighting before it was
proved to whom the land really belonged. The killing
of men at the Omata block naturally followed when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>

once&mdash;as by destroying the pah at Waitara&mdash;war had
begun."</p>

<p>"What became of Te Rangitake's fifty men?"</p>

<p>"Well, a body of the Nga-ti-mania-poto went back
to Taranaki with them under Epiha, the chief. On
the way they met Mr. Parris, the Taranaki land commissioner,
whom the Maoris blamed for the Waitara
affair. Te Rangitake's people wanted to kill him at
once, but Epiha drew up his men, took him under
his protection, and escorted him to a place of safety.
Parris began to thank him, but was stopped at once.</p>

<p>'Friend,' said the chief, 'do not attribute your deliverance
to me, but to God. I shall meet you as an
enemy in the daylight. Now you have seen that I
would not consent to you being murdered.'"</p>

<p>"What a fine trait in a man's character!" said
Massinger. "And what discipline his men were in to
withstand the other fellows, and save the man's life
who was responsible, they believed, for all the mischief!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the Maori chief all over. He has the
most romantic ideas on certain points, and acts up to
them, which is more than our people always do.
But I hear that the Governor is going to stop the
Waitara business for the present&mdash;very sensibly&mdash;and
give the natives south of New Plymouth a lesson."</p>

<p>"And what about the settlers around Taranaki?"</p>

<p>"They have been forced to abandon their farms.
The women and children have taken refuge in the
town, while Colonel Gold has destroyed the mills, crops,
and houses of the natives on the Tataraimaka block.
So the war may be regarded as being fairly, or rather
unfairly, begun; God alone knows when it may end."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> natives alleged that they had taken up arms
against manifest wrong and injustice; but underlying
all other motives and actions was the land question.
The more sagacious chiefs entertained fears of the
alienation of their territories. The growing superiority
of the white settlers troubled them. Outnumbered,
fighting against superior weapons, the day seemed near
when, as in their songs and recitations, they began to
lament, "The Maori people would be like a flock of
birds upon a rock, with the sea rising fast around
them." The time seemed propitious to unite the
tribes against the common foe. The natives were
estimated at sixty thousand, a large number being
available fighting men. One determined assault upon
the whites, who were not, as was supposed, more than
eighty thousand, might settle the question.</p>

<p>Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Fitzherbert said in
the House in 1861 that "the remark that we were
living at the mercy of the natives was <em>true</em>, and
reflected the greatest credit upon them. They had
that knowledge, and yet forbore to use their power."
Now, however, war was declared between the two
races; the untarnished honour of the British flag
must be maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time in the distracted colony there lived,
strange to say, a body of men whose interests were
primarily concerned neither with the acquisition of
land, the profits of trade, nor the so-called prestige of
the British crown. Voyaging to New Zealand long
years ago, they announced themselves to be the bearers
of a Divine message, the significance of which was
nearly two thousand years old. With the weapons
of peace and good will they confronted the savage
conquerors of the day. They lived among them
unharmed, though not always able to prevent the
torture of captives, the execution of enemies taken in
fight, or to stay the hand of the fierce tribes thirsting
for conquest or revenge. But they had done much.
They had laboured zealously and unselfishly. They
had risked their lives, and those of the devoted
wives who had accompanied them into the habitations
of the heathen. Following the example of their
pioneer pastor, the saintly Samuel Marsden, they had
introduced the arts of peace. They had ploughed
and sowed, reaped and garnered. Favoured by the
rich soil and moist climate, the cereals, the plants, the
edible roots of older lands had flourished abundantly.</p>

<p>The heathen, though slow to perceive the benefit of
such labours, had come to comprehend and to imitate.
They shared in the fruits of the earth so abundantly
provided. Trade had sprung up with adjoining
colonies; and, with the white man's tools, his grain,
his horses, his cattle, and sheep, in all of which the
Maori was allowed to participate, came the revelation
of the white man's God, the white man's faith,
the white man's schools; the missionary's example did
the rest. Gradually these agencies commenced to sway

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>

the rude and turbulent tribes. A highly intelligent
race, they deduced rules of conduct from the <em>mikonaree</em>,
who was so different from any species of white
man they had previously known. He was brave, for
did he not from time to time risk his life, for peace'
sake alone, between excited bands of enemies? He
made war on none; he was slow to defend himself;
he trusted for protection in that Great Being who had
preserved him, his wife and little ones, in the midst
of dangers by land and sea. From time to time he
took dangerous journeys, he crossed swollen rivers,
he traversed pathless forests, he risked his life in frail
barks on stormy seas, to prevent war, to release
captives.</p>

<p>After years of toil and trial the reward of these
devoted servants of the Lord appeared to be assured.
Many of the older chiefs, men of weight and authority,
were baptized as earnest converts. Others protected
the missionaries, though they refused to quit the faith
of their ancestors. The schools flourished, and, unprecedented
among other races, aged men learned to
read and write. The Bible was translated into the
simple yet sonorous Maori tongue. Saw-mills and
flour-mills, owned by natives, arose; vessels even were
built for them, in which their produce was taken to
other ports. As far back as the bloodthirsty raids of
Te Waharoa, the ruthless massacres of Hongi and
Rauperaha, the missionary lived amidst the people
for whose spiritual welfare he had dared danger and
death, exile and privation.</p>

<p>The members of the different Christian Churches
had shared emulously in the good work. Wesleyans
and Presbyterians, the Church of England and the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>

Roman Catholic hierarchy, all had their representatives;
all supported ministers vowed to the service of
the heathen. Not always went they scathless. These
soldiers of the Cross had seen their cottage homes
burned, their families driven forth to seek shelter and
protection at a distance. But, even when the worst
passions of contending parties were aroused, there
never failed them a chief or a warrior who took upon
himself the charge of the helpless fugitives.</p>

<p>The earlier missions were organized by remarkable
men. Their descendants occupy high positions, and
inherit the respect which to their fathers was always
accorded. But the most commanding figure in the
little army of Christian soldiers, the most striking
personality, was Selwyn, the first bishop of New
Zealand. No ordinary cleric was the dauntless athlete,
the apostolic prelate, the daring herald of good tidings,
reckless of personal danger whether in war or peace.
When the Waikato warriors, three hundred strong,
went down the river from Ngarua-wahia under the
young Matutauere, the bishop, travelling <i>on foot</i>,
carried a message to friendly chiefs, who undertook
to bar the war-party from passing through their
territory. The settler at whose house the bishop
arrived soon after sunrise, dripping with water from
the fording of a creek, told the story. Had his
remonstrances, strengthened by those of the venerable
Henry Williams, Chief Justice Martin, and Sir William
Denison, received the consideration to which they were
entitled, "the great war of 1860, with its resultant,
the greater war of 1863," would never have been
fought. England's taxpayers would have been richer
by the interest paid on a sum of several millions, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>

England's dead, whose bones are resting in distant
cemeteries, or in unknown graves on many a ferny
hillside, would have been saved to family and friends.</p>

<p>However, at this stage all developments lay
shrouded in the veil of the future. On whosoever
lay the blame, war <em>had</em> commenced in earnest, and,
according to British traditions, must be fought out.
It was arming and hurrying with all classes and all
ages in Auckland, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1860. Volunteers, militia,
regulars, marines, bluejackets, were all under marching
orders; martial law was proclaimed around Taranaki;
all the ingredients of the devil's cauldron were simmering
and ready to burst forth.</p>

<p>If Massinger had desired the excitements of
danger, of battle, murder, and sudden death, this was
the place and the time, to the very hour.</p>

<p>He had found no difficulty in enrolling himself
among the force known as Von Tempsky's Forest
Rangers. It was composed of the most resolute,
daring spirits of the colony, many of whom had either
been born in New Zealand or been brought up there
from infancy. As a rule, used to country life, they
rode well, and were good marksmen. A large proportion
of them were the sons of farmers, but there
were also men who had held good positions in their
day. Having lost their money, or otherwise drifted
out of the ranks of the well-to-do, they cheerfully
enlisted in this arm of the force, which, if irregular
in discipline, had a prestige which the ordinary militia
and volunteer regiments lacked.</p>

<p>In such a corps the personal character of the leader
is everything; and in this respect they were exceptionally
fortunate. Carl Von Tempsky, the son of a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>

Prussian officer high in service, was a soldier of fortune
in the best sense of the word. He had served for
several years with credit, if not distinction, until the
temptation of a free adventurous life proved too
strong for him. He quitted the ranks of the 3rd
Fusiliers for a long ramble in Mexico, during which
he held various military commands.</p>

<p>After this foreign service he travelled through
Central America, and knew Bluefields Bay and the
Mosquito Shore, finally reaching New Zealand a
year before the troublous time which supplied the
warlike excitement in which his nature revelled. Producing
his credentials, he was at once appointed to
the force which, under his leadership, became so celebrated.
His career was assured. Daring to recklessness,
he was yet a thorough disciplinarian. Suave in
manner, but unyielding, he controlled the wilder spirits
in his regiment, while his confident and successful
generalship roused his men to a pitch of enthusiasm
which rendered them well-nigh irresistible in the field.
As scouts they were invaluable, often securing information
of the movements of the enemy, which the superstitious
natives believed to be derived from witchcraft
or sorcery. Their sudden onslaught upon outlying
camps and redoubts demoralized the foe. While, whenever
they had brought anything like an equal force
to bay, they invariably routed them with loss, Von
Tempsky, with his dark flashing eyes and cavalier
curls, bearing himself as though gifted with a charmed
life.</p>

<p>Such was the corps in which Massinger and Warwick
found themselves; for the latter had made up
his mind&mdash;on Mr. Slyde's principle, that in the present

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>

state of affairs "one must join something"&mdash;to follow
the same flag as his erstwhile employer, to whom
he had become personally attached. Of the young
Englishman's courage and liberality he had the highest
opinion; of his prudence he felt doubtful. This was
his chief reason, as he told Mr. Slyde, for enlisting.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to see him shot or tomahawked,"
he said. "He'll make a grand soldier if he gets time;
but he's careless&mdash;deuced careless&mdash;and foolhardy. I'm
afraid of some dog of a Waikato taking a pot-shot at
him from behind a tree while he's thinking of something
a thousand miles away."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The Forest Rangers were a distinguished corps in
which to be enrolled. From the beginning of the
campaign their name had been in every one's mouth.
Their dress was picturesque, though toned down in
regard to the special services on which they were
generally detailed.</p>

<p>More was expected of them by the public than of
any other volunteer force. And the public was not often
disappointed. Von Tempsky was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</i> of a
leader of irregular troops. Full of military ardour, brave
to recklessness, and of singular aptitude for command,
the men under him got into the habit of regarding
themselves as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfants perdus</i>, knew not what fear was,
and carried out with success sorties, reconnoissances,
and scout duty of the most daring and desperate nature.
The work was entirely to Massinger's taste. He found
himself among kindred spirits. His former volunteer
experience stood him in good stead. He was promised
speedy promotion. He came to believe that a
military career in war-time was, after all, his vocation,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>

and, as affording a succession of exciting adventures
and dramatic incidents, the most desirable of all professions.</p>

<p>The minor successes gained by the Waitara tribes
before November, 1860, had much elated the Ngatiawa,
so that they conceived the idea of taking possession
of the Mahoetai hill, close to the main road and
near the Bell Block stockade. More than a hundred
Ngatihauas and Waikatos established themselves there
on a knoll surrounded by flax plants and <i>raupo</i> swamp.
A combined attack of the 40th and 65th Regiments,
with the militia, stormed the position. The volunteers
and a company of the 65th were told off to the assault,
which they made in good style. The Maoris stood
their ground well, killing and wounding some of the
assailants, but eventually were driven out of their rifle-pits.
They took refuge in a swamp, but, the raupo
being fired, fled for their lives. They lost thirty-four
killed and fifty wounded. Several chiefs lay dead,
including Taupo-rutu of Ngatihaua. Two were killed
and four wounded of the volunteers.</p>

<p>After this affair two companies of the Forest
Rangers were detailed, under Captains Von Tempsky
and Jackson, for the purpose of scouring the forest
between the Waikato and Auckland. Life and
property in the settled districts had become insecure.
To the great joy and satisfaction of Messrs. Slyde and
Massinger, they found themselves in the first-named
company, and were soon in the thick of a smart
skirmish, in which two officers of a militia company
were killed and half a dozen rank and file wounded,
the enemy acknowledging more than double.</p>

<p>They were now ceaselessly occupied in scouring

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>

the bush and moving from place to place, for weeks
together having no settled camp or abiding-place.
On the Waiari stream, when sent to clear the enemy
out of the river-scrub, they killed five and took several
prisoners in a very short onset.</p>

<p>A more serious engagement followed, when at
Waiheke they were camped with the Arawa, two
hundred strong, and found the enemy, composed of
Ngaiterangi, Whaha-tohea, and Ngatiporou, awaiting
them near Te Matata. The position was well chosen:
a deep stream in front, on their left flank a raised
beach, their right on the sea. The Forest Rangers
carried the creek with a rush, well supported by the
Arawa, after which the enemy waited no longer, but,
pursued by the Rangers, fled until the Awa-te-Atua
river was reached. The British loss was light, but
included Toi, the brave old chief of the Arawa. The
enemy lost seventy men.</p>

<p>Here Massinger had an opportunity of witnessing
a characteristic incident of Maori warfare. A celebrated
chief of the Whaha-tohea, being taken prisoner,
fully expected to be put to death. Captain Macdonnell
took him under his protection, telling him
that he had nothing to fear. From the men probably
not, but Macdonnell had not calculated on the feelings
of a bereaved wife. Toi's widow, "wroth in wild
despair," persuaded some one to load a rifle for her,
and walking up to the chief, blew his brains out. The
tribe, after much argument, came to a decision much
resembling that of Bret Harte's jury at White Pine,
viz. "Justifiable insanity."</p>

<p>"Must be in luck now," said Mr. Slyde one
morning, after an orderly had been seen riding into

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>

camp. "Shouldn't wonder if the general had got
some special work cut out for us."</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Massinger. "We'll know
soon, as Warwick is talking to Captain St. George,
whom Von is sure to give the first order to. Now
both are called up. Something on by the look of
Warwick. Here he comes."</p>

<p>"Well, where are we to go, most noble earl and
king-maker? Route to the Uriwera or the Reinga?"</p>

<p>"There's an off chance of the last place for some
of us," said Warwick, who didn't care for Maori
jokes, detached, as by education and travel he had
become, from his maternal relatives. "The route is
to the Patea River near the edge of a forest, where
the whole of the tribes of the North Island might
hide. The villages there are not exactly in trees, but
nearly as hard to climb up to."</p>

<p>"All the better&mdash;give us new ideas," said Slyde.
"Tired of this flat country work.</p>

<p>What a country this would be for red deer! By the
way, I wonder if I shall ever have the luck to pot a

we start, and how many men?"</p>

<p>"Two companies, fifty each. Daylight in the
morning. Camp at Kakaramea."</p>

<p>Stationed at this inviting locality, where, as Mr.
Slyde remarked, the country consisted of hills without
valleys, rivers without bridges, and inconvenient cliffs

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>

thrown in, the hawk eyes of Warwick discovered a
track leading up the face of an almost perpendicular
cliff.</p>

<p>"This track goes up the cliff, but how are <em>we</em> to
go up?" asked Massinger. "A goat couldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Do you see those climbers carelessly thrown
along the track?"</p>

<p>"I do see some supple-jack here and there."</p>

<p>"Those," said Warwick, "are Maori ladders, which
you will find strong enough when it is your turn to
try them. Of the two, I would rather trust to them
than ordinary rope."</p>

<p>"When do we start?" asked Massinger.</p>

<p>"Not today, or perhaps tomorrow. They have
scouts on the watch. The major won't move until
they get careless. Then a midnight affair."</p>

<p>"Regular 'Der Freischutz' business," said Slyde.
"Hour midnight. Circle. Skulls neatly arranged.
'Zamiel, come forth!' etc. Owls in forest, please
attend. Come to think, we <em>are</em> rather in the Freischutz
line. If we get back to Auckland one of these
fine days (or years), good idea for private theatricals."</p>

<p>"We shall have them in private and public," said
Warwick, "before the season's over. Likely to end
up with a tragedy, too."</p>

<p>"Tragedy or comedy, we shall be in the front row,"
said Massinger; "but, the overture not having commenced,
we can't criticize the performance. Our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeun
premier</i>, Von Tempsky, however, would do honour to
any opera in Europe. What a romantic-looking fellow
he is in his undress uniform! Calm, yet determined-looking,
an expression which would never alter in the
face of death. Hair worn longer than we Englishmen

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>

affect, but it becomes some people. As a fashion it's
certain to come in again. Cavalry sabre, forage cap,
blue tunic, boots to the knee,&mdash;there you have him.
He would have been a <em>Feld</em> some day if he had
remained in the Imperial service."</p>

<p>"Better that he is with us to-night," said Warwick.
"Besides being a first-class leader, he is one of the
smartest scouts that ever picked up a track. Did
you ever hear what he did at Papa-rata? Many a
man wears the Victoria Cross for less."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is, heard generally. Tell us about it,"
said Slyde. "Afraid I shouldn't do much in that line."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," said Massinger. "I am all ears."</p>

<p>"You'll never be all eyes, captain," said Warwick,
with a grim smile. "And by Maori custom a captured
scout is doomed to tortures that can't be told. I
always keep one shot in my revolver."</p>

<p>"For whom?" asked Massinger.</p>

<p>"For <em>myself</em>, if ever I'm 'jumped,'" answered Warwick,
who had acquired, among his other experiences,
a few miner's idioms. "But here is the story. The
general wanted a sketch of the enemy's works at
Papa-rata, which they had occupied in force. Our
Von undertook the service&mdash;sort of forlorn hope business&mdash;and,
like everything he ever began, carried it
out thoroughly. He managed to hide himself in the
scrub and flax in the very midst of the natives, and,
far worse for discovery, their prowling dogs, popularly
supposed to wind a white man a mile off. There he
calmly sketched the position, and got safe back into
camp. They gave him his commission for it."</p>

<p>"And well he deserved it," said Massinger.</p>

<p>"So say I," chimed in Slyde. "Good thing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>

about a war, attracts best fellows of all nationalities&mdash;Johnnies
that prefer discomfort and revel in danger;
used to light marching order, too. Sort of war correspondent
business; murder and sudden death thrown
in. Deuced exhilarating when you come to think of it."</p>

<p>"Do you know, I find it so," answered Massinger,
entering into the joke. "And our light marching
order is a triumph of economy of space. Nothing
approaches it but a middy's wardrobe, and he has a
ship to carry it. I must have myself photographed
when we&mdash;may I say <em>if</em>&mdash;we return to camp. Let
me see&mdash;Forest Ranger, 'in his habit as he lived;'
applicable to either case, you see. Item&mdash;<i>Swag</i>. Did
I think I should ever carry one? One blanket, one
great coat, twenty rounds of ammunition, all put up
in a waterproof; three days' rations of meat and
biscuit; half a bottle of rum. Revolver, carbine,
cartridge-box, tomahawk&mdash;all most useful, not to say
ornamental, when sliding down precipices in the dark,
as we did on entering camp last night."</p>

<p>"Camp accommodation; don't forget that," added
Slyde.</p>

<p>"Fire strictly forbidden. Sleeping apartment of
the wild boar of the forest. I'll swear that where
you and I, Warwick and Hay, slept last night&mdash;for
we <em>did</em> sleep&mdash;under the hollow rimu tree, had
belonged to one. 'Feeds the boar in the old frank,'
as the wild prince says. Also, over and above all
these pleasures and palaces, our lives hang on a chance
from day to day&mdash;that of being surrounded in the
heart of a forest, and cut off to a man."</p>

<p>"Conversation most improvin'," said Mr. Slyde.
"Seems to lack the comic element, though! 'Want a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>

piano,' as the Johnnie said to Thackeray after lecture.
As we've an early <em>engagement</em>&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;in the morning,
suppose we turn in? Now 'I lay me down to
sleep.' Rain recommencing. 'Drought broken up,'
as they say in Australia."</p>

<p>It was not very late&mdash;nine o'clock, indeed, no
more. Camp evenings were apt to be long without
late dinners or books. However, it not being their
watch, the friends lay down in their "lair," and in five
minutes, despite the rain, from which, indeed, the o'er-arching
tree in great part saved them, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>At midnight on the third day the march was recommenced
and the cliff path reached. Von Tempsky,
with seventy men, made a start punctually, as was
his wont. Massinger felt doubtfully entertained at
the idea of swinging in mid-air, clinging to a rude
arrangement of trailers, with, perhaps, expectant
Maoris at the top. However, he forbore remark,
and after he had seen Von Tempsky shin up the
swaying half-seen line like a man-of-war Jack, he
felt reassured.</p>

<p>"What a leader he is!" thought he.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are all in hard condition, luckily."</p>

<p>Between the precarious foothold on the cliff and
the ladder of withes&mdash;Warwick, by the way, was
immediately behind him&mdash;he reached the top safely.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" he said, as Warwick sprang up
and stood by his side. "I shouldn't care, though, to
go <em>down</em> the same way, especially if they had crossed
our track and decided to wait there for our return."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"They would find an officer and thirty men there,"
said Warwick. "Our Von always takes care to leave
a place open for retreat. Catch him napping!"</p>

<p>Dawn found them in a deserted village, recently
occupied, however, as the fires were still alight.
Pushing on across a gorge, smoke was seen rising,
and on the summit of the ridge a large clearing was
sighted, with a number of whares at the other end.</p>

<p>"There they are!" said Massinger.</p>

<p>"Those whares are only temporary," explained
Warwick&mdash;"used by the natives to put in a crop or take
it up. I can see Maoris; they don't see us, however."</p>

<p>The order came at that moment to extend in line
along the forest edge, behind a barricade of dead
timber, thrown aside from the clearing. This they
climbed, but were immediately seen by the natives,
who fired a volley, mortally wounding a young officer
and one of the Rangers. The senior officer, next to
Von Tempsky, was also hit. The attempt to dislodge
the enemy from some fallen timber, under cover of
which they were able to hold the attacking force in
check, failed, owing to their right resting on a cliff,
not previously noticed. A smart skirmish took place,
however, in which the enemy was routed, leaving
three dead on the ground.</p>

<p>"Had the best of it," said Mr. Slyde after supper.
"Not a glorious victory, though, by any means. Two
to one&mdash;bad exchange against natives. Poor young
Stansfield, too! Took me and Warwick all we knew
to get him down that beastly ladder."</p>

<p>"Poor chap!" said Massinger. "What spirits
he was in when we started! Stark and cold now.
Fortune of war, I suppose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bush-fighting not all beer and skittles," remarked
his companion. "Better luck next time."</p>

<p>One of the really "stunning engagements" (as
Mr. Slyde phrased it) in which Massinger and his
two comrades took active part, was the fight before
Paterangi. The enemy's works were about three
miles distant from the headquarters' camp at Te Rore.</p>

<p>The sailors, under Lieutenant Hill, H.M.S. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Curaçoa</i>,
had their camp close to the landing-place, to which
the <em>Avon</em>, with stores, made daily trips.</p>

<p>The tars, to relieve the monotony of camp life,
had got hold of cricketing materials, and on fine
afternoons the stumps were set up and play carried
on, <em>secundum artem</em>, as unconcernedly as if there was
no such thing as a Maori foe within a few hundred
yards of them.</p>

<p>"Look at Von Tempsky!" said Slyde (the
Rangers being at headquarters in case any specially
dangerous scouting was on hand.) "Cool as if he
was listening to a military band in Berlin. Trifle
better music there, I dare say. Picturesque-looking
beggar, isn't he? Cigar in mouth, forage cap always
on the side of his head. Curls <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à ravir</i>. Not our
form, but they become him. Wouldn't think he was
the man that spoilt an ambush at Mount Egmont,
when the general made his point to point march
through the bush there."</p>

<p>"Just the man, I should think. But how was it?"</p>

<p>"Rangers, you see, marched with the column.
Passing through thickest spot, Von left track with
his men and vanished. Troops thought took wrong
path. Sharp firing heard. Von reappears front of
the column, forcing his way through the supple-jacks,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>

sword in one hand, revolver in the other, knife
between his teeth, dripping with blood. Ambush
laid for troops&mdash;destroyed it."</p>

<p>"No wonder everybody swears by him. I suppose
these fellows would have had a steady volley at the
column?"</p>

<p>"Regular pot-shot. Sure to kill officers, besides
twenty or thirty Tommies. Might even have bagged
the general. Great hand at the bowie-knife, Von.
Learned that in Mexico. Throws it to an inch.
Great weapon at close quarters."</p>

<p>"I dare say," replied Massinger. "I don't seem
to take to it myself. All's fair in war, of course."</p>

<p>"Suppose we have a bathe in the Mangopiko?
It feels warmer this afternoon."</p>

<p>This motion being carried, our triumvirate proceeded
to the river-bank with a party of the 40th,
men who bathed there every day.</p>

<p>"The water's all right," said Warwick, "but I don't
like this manuka scrub. The river's not too wide,
and there's good cover on the other side."</p>

<p>"Surely there's no chance of there being natives
so close to the camp?" said Massinger, who thought
Warwick a trifle over-cautious this time, often as he
had reason to admit his astonishing accuracy in all
that concerned woodcraft.</p>

<p>This occasion was not destined to be an exception,
for no sooner had they undressed than a volley from
across the river showed that natives <em>had</em> been concealed
on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a covering party of twenty men under
a lieutenant had been sent with them, who immediately
returned fire, and a sharp exchange began.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>

The sounds of the firing brought up a reinforcement
from the 40th and 50th Regiments, under Colonel
Havelock, who got to the rear of the concealed
natives, the same ti-tree which had screened them
serving to hide the troops. At an old earthwork they
came suddenly upon them. Captain Jackson of the
Forest Rangers and Captain Headley of the Auckland
Rifles marched with the supports, eventually driving
the Maoris from their position in the earthwork. A
hot rally while it lasted, but a Victoria Cross was
gained in it by Captain Headley, who, under heavy
fire and with his clothes riddled with bullets, carried
out a wounded soldier.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;d nuisance!" said Mr. Slyde, resuming his
garments. "Left arms at camp, or we might have
had a throw in. Other chaps got all the fun. Oh,
here comes Warwick, <em>heavily</em> armed, and no mistake."</p>

<p>It was even so. That resourceful henchman had
bolted back to camp and returned with his arms full
of their carbines and revolvers.</p>

<p>"And, by Jove! here comes Von Tempsky and
part of our company," exclaimed Massinger, unusually
excited. "Was there ever such luck?"</p>

<p>No time was lost in joining the Rangers, who
had just been ordered to cross the river and clear
the scrub.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, headed by Von
Tempsky, they plunged into the stream, and emerging
like modern river-gods dripping with the Mangopiko,
rushed on the enemy. A desperate hand-to-hand
fight ensued. The natives retreated, leaving
eight dead, side by side, amid the trampled fern.
The Rangers only had three men wounded, including

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>

Mr. Massinger, in the arm&mdash;his first title to distinction,
as having bled in the cause of his Queen and country.</p>

<p>Like many other small wars and skirmishes, it led
to complications. A body of natives came out from
the pah at Paterangi to help their people. The
skirmishers of the 40th were thrown forward to check
them. Five men killed and six wounded of the
40th, while the natives from Paterangi lost over forty
killed and thirty wounded.</p>

<p>Mr. Massinger's arm was sore enough that night,
though he was loth to admit it.</p>

<p>"'Quite enough to get,' as the soldier remarked
in 'Pickwick.' Deuced hot work while it lasted. New
style of bathing-party. Have to look up a tree before
you sit under it next. Maoris everywhere."</p>

<p>"'All's well that ends well,'" rejoined Massinger,
with his arm in a sling. "Lucky that Warwick
brought the carbines. I wouldn't have missed that
dash across the river for worlds. We also covered
the rear effectually, Von Tempsky marching as if he
was on parade."</p>

<p>"He wasn't the only one who was cool," said
Warwick. "The adjutant-surgeon stopped the bleeding
in your arm as steady as if he was in the hospital
tent. Bullets pretty thick, too."</p>

<p>The colonel commanding did justice to the
merits of all concerned, and when Lieutenant Roland
Massinger's name occurred in the list of wounded
among the Forest Rangers, under Major Von
Tempsky, that gentleman felt himself more than
recompensed for any trifling inconvenience he might
have undergone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> campaign dragged on till June, the antipodean
mid-winter, was reached. Dark were the long cold
nights, ceaseless the rain, as the troops and volunteers
struggled through forests knee-deep in mud, with
creeks to ford and flax swamps to wade through.</p>

<p>An insufficient commissariat tried the constitution
of the hardiest. Massinger was now in a position to
comprehend thoroughly the fearful odds against which
the British regulars fought in the American revolutionary
war. There they confronted an enemy whose
very children, as soon as they were strong enough to
lift the long rifle of the period, were the deadliest of
marksmen.</p>

<p>Behind the forest pillars or beneath the fallen logs,
what perfect cover had the backwoodsmen, trained
to all woodcraft and inured to a hunter's life, where
subsistence often depended upon patient stalking and
accuracy of aim!</p>

<p>Almost similar conditions prevailed in this guerilla
warfare to which England's armaments stood committed.
The "mute Maori" glided through the
underbrush or amid the fern, himself invisible, until
he arose in open order before the astonished troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>he had winded from afar. Reckless in assault as
elusive in retreat, the desperate Maori seemed a
demoniac foe. Living on fern-root, shell-fish, or
kumera, he needed no baggage. The women of the
tribe, mingling with the warriors, cooked the necessary
food, carried off the wounded, and were not averse
to occasional fighting. With ten thousand regular
troops, as well as levies of militia and volunteers against
them, with powerful tribes of their own race, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rusés</i>
and daring as themselves, who fought for the pakeha
with a ferocity not exceeded in the bloodiest tribal
wars, their position appeared hopeless. Still the
stubborn Maori held his own. In staying power, as
in other respects, the aboriginal, the Briton of the
South, displayed his similarity to his Northern prototype.
No such conflict had been waged by an
aboriginal race against the arms of civilization since
the Iceni and the Brigantes confronted Cæsar's
legions, fought the world's masters for generation
after generation, century after century, till, wearied
with the profitless strife and barren occupation, they
withdrew, and left the savage inhabitants to a climate
of such rigour and gloom that they alone seemed to
be its fitting inhabitants. Such for a time appeared
to be no improbable <em>finale</em> to the Waikato war.
Months, even years, passed without tangible result,
without solid advantage to the invaders.</p>

<p>So the seasons wore on, until Massinger began to
look upon himself less as a colonist than a soldier.
"The reveillé," the bugle-call, became familiar to him
and his companions; for neither Slyde nor Warwick,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>

more than himself, dreamed of quitting service until
the war was over, the play played out.</p>

<p>Both Englishmen had been wounded at different
times, but so far not severely. They were commencing
to feel the true fatalism of the soldier, convinced that
they were invulnerable until their predestined hour.
They came to be well known among the forces, with
their guide, from whom they were rarely separated.
With no personal interest in the matter, with no land
to defend, no interest to conserve, they remained
simply because they happened to be on the spot,
and, coming of fighting blood, had no power to withdraw
themselves from the fascination of battle, murder,
and sudden death.</p>

<p>Strange as it seemed to Massinger, they had never
happened to meet Erena. They heard of her from
time to time, but Mannering and his <i>hapu</i>, though
always at the front, were either in another direction
when they fell across the Ngapuhi contingent, or the
Forest Rangers were on outpost duty.</p>

<p>Nor was intelligence wanting of traits of heroism
on her part in the numerous skirmishes and sorties
of which her father was the leader. Dressed like his
Maori allies, with a plume of feathers in his hair,
with cartridge-pouch and waistbelt accoutred proper,
wherever the fight was fiercest, high above friend and
foe rose the tall form of Allister Mannering.</p>

<p>And ever as the battle-waves surged forward,
or were rolled back by superior forces, the eager,
fearless face, the huntress form of Erena was seen,
disdainful of danger as the fabled goddess in the
Trojan war. Her chosen band of dusky maidens&mdash;relatives
or near friends&mdash;accepted her guidance, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>

surrounded her in every engagement; many a
wounded soldier or native ally had they borne from
the fray, or succoured when wounded and helpless
on the field. Often had they warned outlying settlers
when the prowling <i>taua</i> was approaching the unsuspecting
family. Nay, it was asserted that had Erena's
counsel been taken, her letter regarded, the murder
of the missionary, with wife and babes, might have
been averted. Sometimes near, sometimes afar, but
never absolutely within speech or vision, the situation
to Massinger's aroused imagination became tantalizing
to such a painful degree that he felt resolved to
terminate it without further delay.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that he was without
occasional tidings from that land of his fathers, from
which, as he sometimes considered, he had hastily
exiled himself.</p>

<p>For was it not exile, in the fullest sense of the
word? &#338;dipus in Colona was a joke to it. Was
this travel-stained, over-wearied, haggard man, who
trudged day by day, and often from night to dawn,
through darksome woods and endless marshes, in
daily risk of being "shot like a rabbit in a ride," the
same Massinger of the Court, who was wont to turn
out so spick and span at covert and copse?</p>

<p>He could hardly believe it, any more than that
the sardonic soldier at his side, whose unsparing
comments included the Government, the New Zealand
Company, the soldiers, and the sailors, the general,
the governor, the colonists, the natives, by no means
excepting himself, as the champion idiots of the century,
was the erstwhile debonair Dudley Slyde, faultless in
costume as unapproachable in languid elegance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been observed that a campaign brings out
the best or worst points of a man's character. This
struck Massinger as a proposition proved to demonstration
when he saw the cheerful acquiescence of
Mr. Slyde in the drudgeries and dangers of their
harassing expeditions. He it was who volunteered
for "fatigue" duty by night or day; ready at any
hour to help to bury the dead, to forage for provisions,
to cover retreat, to attend the wounded, at the same
time keeping up the cheerfulness of the rank and
file by his withering execrations, which, from their
very incongruousness, always provoked the laughter
of his comrades.</p>

<p>The simple privates voted him the "rummest
chap as ever they see," at the same time fully appreciating
his coolness under fire and many-sided utility.</p>

<p>Nor was Warwick unmindful of the necessity of
keeping up the reputation of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les trois mousquetaires</i>, as
they were occasionally called. He exhibited in his
personal traits certain distinct tendencies derived
from an admixture of the races. Grave, steadfast,
and trustworthy, obedient to orders, as became his
Anglo-Saxon descent, he was occasionally affected
with the Berserker frenzy of his mother's people. At
such moments he would rush to the front, heedless
of friends or foes, and indulge himself in the blood-fury
of her reckless race. When mixed up with
friendly natives he would stalk through the hottest
of the fire with those younger chiefs, who desired to
have some daring achievement to boast of when the
war was over. It more than once happened that his
companions returned no more, having fallen to a
man in the breach, or when they had surmounted the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>

lofty palisades which engirdled the fortress, behind
which lay trench and fascine, gallery and bastion. So
far Warwick had always returned, blood-stained and
powder-blackened, with torn uniform and dimmed
accoutrements, dropping with fatigue, and half dead
with thirst, but safe and unharmed, ready&mdash;and more
than ready&mdash;for the next day's exploits. When in
this mood he had been seen side by side with the
famous Winiata, standing on the parapet of a beleaguered
redoubt, having guns handed to them, with
which they kept up a ceaseless fusilade, they themselves
the centre of a close and deadly volley.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of war's alarms the English soldier
finds time for recreative pastime and the omnipresent
national sports.</p>

<p>Football and cricket, polo and other matches
flourish, in which distinction is enjoyed with a pathetic
disregard of the morrow. When it chances that the
"demon bowler" of the regiment, who has taken five
wickets in four "overs," is himself bowled next day
with a smaller ball and yet more deadly delivery, short
shrift and brief requiem suffice. The batsman's stumps
are scattered, and no L.B.W. affords an appeal to the
umpire.</p>

<p>In polo the fortune of war, indeed, dwarfs the
untoward accidents of the game. Who can object to
a "crumpler" of a fall, when horse and rider may so
soon form part of the sad company "in one red
burial blent"? No! the bugle-call sounds to arms,
and his comrades form in line, all unheeding of the
gap in the ranks.</p>

<p>There is a superficial appearance of callousness
about our British customs in this respect. But none

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>

the less is deep and sincere mourning made for the
dead; none the less among Britons in action all over
the world is care for the wounded, self-sacrificing
heroism in the field, so common as to be inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Hurdle-racing, not to say steeplechasing, was in
abeyance, owing to the low condition of the cavalry
arm, and the extreme difficulty in procuring fodder.
The climate and the native pasture forbade the grass-feeding,
which in Australia would have been all-sufficing.
But polo, owing to the exertions of those officers
who had served in India, and to the occasional capture
of Maori ponies, became most popular. Football,
again, was eminently suited to the damp and cold
region in which their lines were cast, and supplied
the means of warmth and exercise at small cost.</p>

<p>These sports kept up the spirits of the variously
gathered forces. The Maori allies took to the game
of football with zest and enthusiasm, their astonishing
activity and strength making them almost an overmatch
for their British instructors. Their shouts and
war-cries, when there was no particular need for
caution, made the camp lively and animated, tending
to produce, as similar sports peculiar to England and
her colonies always do, a feeling of harmony and good
fellowship between the different orders and races, invaluable
for the <em>morale</em> of the heterogeneous force
gathered on the banks of the Waikato.</p>

<p>But all other interests and expectations were dulled
in comparison with those which prevailed on the day
when the somewhat irregular arrival of the mails took
place.</p>

<p>Often by water would the messenger appear.
A canoe would steal up to river-bank or lake-shore

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>

at midnight, freighted with the hopes and fears of a
thousand lives; or a solitary native would come tearing
through the mazes of the forest, bleeding from briars,
panting audibly, like an Indian runner in the old
French war of the Canadas, and, casting down the
precious wallet with a "hugh!" expressive of deep
relief, saunter off to the Maori camp, where a sufficiency
of pork and kumera awaited him, or at the
worst, dried shark, pippi, and fern-root.</p>

<p>Then, as the priceless missives were handed to
the feverishly expectant possessors, what sudden
revulsions of feeling were apparent! Few had sufficient
self-control to await the moment when the
contents could be devoured in secrecy. But, standing
about in all directions, could the recipients be descried
with open letter and expressive features, relaxed, fixed,
satisfied, overjoyed, relieved, despairing, according as
the Fates had dealt the measure of weal or woe.</p>

<p>At such a momentous ordeal, when his letters
were given to Massinger, one came in the well-known
hand of Mrs. Merivale, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Branksome.</p>

<p>Putting the collection into his pocket without trace
of excitement, he wended his way to his tent, where,
seating himself, he opened the envelope, and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">"My dear Sir Roland</span>,</p>

<p>"As Harry sees all your letters, and occasionally
criticizes mine from a man's point of view
(terribly wrong, as I always tell him), I may without
indiscretion supply the possessive prefix. Sounds
quite learned, doesn't it? Besides, ten&mdash;or is it not
twelve?&mdash;thousand miles' distance prevents a hint of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>

impropriety in our correspondence. After all this
explanation, I proceed to say 'How do you do?'
How are you getting on in that most unpleasant
war, which would be ludicrous if it were not so
dangerous, and into which you seem to have rushed
for no conceivable reason, but because you disapprove
and have no earthly interest connected with it? Talk
of man being a rational being, indeed!</p>

<p>"He often argues like one, but how rarely&mdash;almost
never, indeed&mdash;does he <em>act</em> in accordance with his
theories!</p>

<p>"However, like all decent Englishmen embarked
in a quarrel, you are bound in honour to go through
with it. The question which perplexes your friends&mdash;and
you have a few, rather more than the average,
indeed&mdash;is <em>why</em> you should have gone into it at all.
I am not going to say 'Que le diable, etc.'&mdash;by the
way, I ought to have stopped at the 'Que'&mdash;but we
all <em>think so</em>!</p>

<p>"One exhausts one's self in trying to find a cause
(reason, of course, there is none) for this effect; that
is, for your migration to the 'other side of the world,'
as Jean Ingelow has it in that dear song of hers. I
have been reading German philosophy lately, and now
know that you must go much further back than is
generally thought necessary for people's tastes and
dispositions, principles, and actions.</p>

<p>"This, then, would be the formula. First, Hypatia's
parents, or one of them, having, on account of some
accidental family trait, bestowed upon her an abnormally
altruistic nature.</p>

<p>"Then they proceed to furnish her with a shamefully
superior and unnecessary education, developing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>

her intellect at the expense of her common sense, so
that she feels herself vowed to the social advancement
of the masses (as if they are not even now unpleasantly
close to the classes). This by the way.</p>

<p>"Cause No. 2: Strenuous attempts to move the
social fabric, with the usual effect&mdash;loss of health and
failure of 'mission,' self-dedicated.</p>

<p>"Cause No. 3: Her refusal of the 'plain duty of
womanhood,' and so on, which wrecks <em>your</em> career, as
far as we can see, without improving her own. However,
she will doubtless plead that 'her intentions
were good.' Harry, who has been looking over my
shoulder (most improperly, I tell him), comes out
with, 'D&mdash;n her intentions!' (or words to that effect).
'Women always say so when they've made a more
destructive muddle of things than usual!' He has
now been chased out of the room, so I proceed to
finish my letter in peace.</p>

<p>"As it <em>is</em> nearing the end, I may treat you to a
bit of news which you may regard as more important
than the whole of the preceding despatch. Our
mutual friend has a dearest chum in New Zealand,
to whom she is devoted&mdash;the wife of a missionary
clergyman. They live in your shockingly disturbed
district, where for some years they have been converting
the heathen with gratifying results. This
Mary Summers is the best of young women, and,
when she is not making 'moral pocket 'ankerchers,'
writes to our Hypatia. I don't want to be irreverent
(Harry says&mdash;well, never mind; but he doesn't like
that kind of thing&mdash;says it's bad form), only the
temptation was irresistible. Well, where was I? Oh!
she says 'the field' is most interesting; the Maoris

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>

are a noble race&mdash;ten times more worthy of a life's
devotion than our slum savages, and so on. Well,
Hypatia, being discouraged about <em>them</em>, appears to
me to incline to a Maori crusade. So that it is
<em>possible</em>&mdash;mind, I go no further&mdash;that one of these
days you might see 'the&mdash;er&mdash;one loved name,' or
'once loved,' as the case might be, in a passenger
list.</p>

<p>"More wonderful things have happened before
now, and I certainly <em>did</em> find her reading 'Ranulf
and Amohia' the other day.</p>

<p>"It is really <em>dreadful</em> the length of this letter of
mine. However, I must tell you a little news. Your
successor at Massinger Court has got on very well
with the county. Just at first, of course, people, after
the manner of our cautious country-folk, fought shy
of them. After a while, however, they were voted
'nice,' especially after Lord Lake, an ex-Governor,
and his wife, Lady Maud, came down to stay with
them, and it leaked out that they were related to the
Lexingtons of Saxmundham. Not that <em>they</em> mentioned
the fact. Harry says the son is a capital fellow&mdash;rides,
shoots, hunts, in most proper style, quiet in
manner, but amusing, and plays polo and cricket
better than most men.</p>

<p>"The girls, too, are pretty and pleasant, great at
tennis and archery, besides being musical. The father
subscribes liberally to the county charities, and is hand-and-glove
with the parson, who says he is unusually
well read. So you are in danger of being forgotten&mdash;do
you hear, sir?&mdash;and serve you right, by all but <em>a
very few</em>, who still think occasionally of the <em>rightful

<p>The dawn was breaking on the morning of a cold
and gusty day, as the shivering men of the No. 2
Company of the Forest Rangers were drying themselves
at an indifferent fire, when Warwick held up
a warning hand.</p>

<p>"Some one coming."</p>

<p>Mr. Slyde lifted his rifle carelessly, and remarked,
"A morning call. One of our scouts, or a <i>toa</i> bent
on death or glory. He should have come last night,
when we were too tired to cook supper; now I feel
as if a brush with the 'hostiles' would revive me."</p>

<p>"It's no native," affirmed Warwick. "He has
boots on, and is walking too fast for a surprise party.
Here he comes."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the bush parted, and a plainly dressed
man in dark clothes walked rapidly across the open
ground in front of the camp.</p>

<p>"By Jove, it's the bishop!" said Mr. Slyde. Then
advancing, he bowed, and in deeply respectful tones
greeted the apostolic prelate who departed so seriously
from the modern manner of bishops of the Established
Church.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, my lord, that you have had an
uncomfortable journey; you must have started early
if you came from Pukerimu."</p>

<p>"Comfort and I have long been at odds," said
the stranger&mdash;for it was indeed George Augustus
Selwyn, the famous Bishop of New Zealand, who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>

stood there drenched to the skin, with the water
dripping from his garments&mdash;"and will be until this
unhappy war is over. The fact is, that I heard
through a native convert that the missionaries at
Ohaupo were in danger, so I started at midnight to
warn them. The creek was flooded, or I should not
have looked so much like a drowned rat."</p>

<p>Massinger, who had been gazing intently at the
devoted Churchman of whom he had heard such
wondrous stories&mdash;tales of his courage, his athletic
feats, his influence among the natives, his eloquence,
his tender treatment of the wounded on both sides&mdash;was
lost in admiration as he gazed at the expressive
countenance, so noble in its simplicity. He now came
forward with an offer of a change of garments.</p>

<p>"My friend, Lieutenant Massinger," said Mr. Slyde,
introducing him. "He has only joined recently, and,
indeed, is but lately from England."</p>

<p>"Massinger of the Court? Surely not!" said the
bishop, with an air of much interest. "How strange
that we should meet thus! I knew your people well
before I left England. I will not ask you how you
came to be thus engaged, but must content myself
with declining your courteous offer. We are all in
one boat as to discomfort. I am only bearing my
share of the common burden; and, indeed, I believe
that were I to trouble my head about these trifling
privations, I should lose my robust health, and, like
some of my poor native parishioners, become a prey
to ordinary ailments."</p>

<p>At this stage of the interview an orderly arrived
with a pressing invitation from the senior officer of
the Forest Rangers, who trusted that his lordship

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>

would not delay joining their mess at breakfast; so,
with a hearty expression of thanks and adieu, this devoted
soldier of the Church Militant departed with the
orderly, every soldier within sight saluting as he passed.</p>

<p>"That's a <em>man</em>, if you like!" said Mr. Slyde. "If
there were more like him, no other religion would
have a chance with ours. Travelled on foot from
coast to coast&mdash;in all weathers, too. Night or day,
high water or low, hot or cold, all alike to him.
Opposed to the war, too, back and edge. Government
taken his advice, never have broken out."</p>

<p>"And now, what is his work?"</p>

<p>"Peace and good will on earth. Can't be hoped
for just yet, of course. Making the best of it now,
until the end comes. Risked his life over and over
again. Worst of it, natives beginning to doubt him&mdash;fired
at him, indeed. Feels it bitterly, they say.
Been advised to keep out of the way. Scorns
prudence. Says it's his duty to go to the front.
Careful only about other men's lives."</p>

<p>"I've often heard of him," said Massinger; "I'm
thankful now that I've seen him. It does one good
to meet an apostle in the flesh."</p>

<p>"Not an extra religious man myself," said Mr.
Slyde; "but deep respect for the man, apart from
his cloth. Black his boots any day, and feel proud
to do it, by Jove!"</p>

<p>Breakfast concluded, there were certain military
duties to be observed, at the conclusion of which the
lieutenant made his way to headquarters, hoping for
an interview with this heroic personage. To his
regret, he found that, with characteristic rapidity of
action, he had already departed, but had found time

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>

to write hastily the note which was now handed to
him. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">My dear Young Friend</span> (if I may so address you),</p>

<p>"You can hardly imagine the mingled feelings
which your presence in this camp called up. Your
county adjoins mine, and I have heard of your family
ever since I can remember. Knowing its position, I
can hardly imagine what could have brought about
your departure from the land we all hold so dear.</p>

<p>"Mine was a call, imperative and irresistible. I
could not refuse to perform my Master's work. I
should have, perhaps, been unduly puffed up by the
success of my previous efforts, had not this disastrous
war come to lower my pride. I have been chastened,
God only knows how severely. May it be for my
soul's good! You are in the ranks of those who are
fighting&mdash;some in defence of a policy of injustice;
others, like yourself, I feel certain, merely as a protest
against the domination of a savage race&mdash;in defence
of the hearths and homes which a victorious foe
would desecrate. Of the inception of the war you
and your friend, Mr. Slyde, I know, are innocent.</p>

<p>"Among our native allies, the Ngapuhi and the
Rarawa tribes have ever been true and faithful. The
chiefs Waka Nene and Patuone, in their steadfast
adherence to the Christian faith and unswerving
loyalty to our Queen, may well serve as examples to
men in high position. Farewell! and may He who is
able to save both body and soul, preserve you through
all dangers, now and evermore.</p>

<p class="p15">"Believe me to be</p>
<p class="p17">"Most truly yours,</p>
<p class="p20">"<span class="smcap">G. A. New Zealand</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall meet again," thought the recipient of
the apostolic epistle&mdash;"we <em>must</em> do so, with leisure
to hear his opinion on this most vexed question of
the war. I wish with all my heart that it <em>was</em> over.
But a peace would be worse than nothing unless
we fully proved our superiority. These Waikatos
and Ngatihaua must not be suffered to think that they
have repulsed the whole British army. The country
would be impossible to <em>live</em> in. And we can't afford to
lose such a brace of islands as these, the nearest approach,
in climate, soil, and adaptation to the British
race, of any land yet occupied. Not to be thought of."</p>

<p>And here he began to hum a song in which the
glories of Britain on land and sea were set forth, and
for the moment forgot his virtuous indignation against
the occupation of Taharaimaka and the injustice of
the Waitara business.</p>

<p>And so the war progressed, sometimes with passages
of toilsome marching, daring attack of pah or
redoubt, hairbreadth escapes, wounds, and inevitable
incidents of warfare. Ever and anon a brilliant
surprise, a masterly man&#630;uvre on the part of the
troops or allies, followed by an ambuscade planned
by the natives with consummate skill, or a desperate
stand in their entrenchments, where the loss of
officers was unduly great, and the rank and file
suffered severely. When it was considered that
nearly three years had elapsed in a campaign where
ten thousand British regulars, and nearly as many
volunteers and native allies, were arrayed against the
Maoris, who at no time could have had five thousand
men in the field, it seemed amazing that no decisive
victory should have been obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Talk of its being 'one of Britain's little wars,'
as the newspapers call it!" grumbled Mr. Slyde. "My
belief is that it is going to last as long as that
confounded Carthaginian business. How they used
to bore us with it at school! Beginning bad enough&mdash;end
probably worse. Fellows die of old age, unless
we hurry up."</p>

<p>"It does drag fearfully; it's only bearable when
we're in action. This lagging guerilla business, with
such a commissariat&mdash;all the privations of war, and
none of the excitement&mdash;is simply unendurable.
However, when Warwick comes in from his scouting
prowl we may hear something."</p>

<p>"Wonder he doesn't get 'chopped' some of these
fine days. Certainly manages to pick up information
in a wonderful way. Von Tempsky says he's
thrown away upon us two. Wants to get him for
scout business pure and simple."</p>

<p>"For some inscrutable reason he has attached
himself to me," said Massinger. "I suggested that
he might do good service by acting in that capacity&mdash;alone.
He didn't take kindly to it at all&mdash;seemed
hurt; so I let him alone."</p>

<p>"Best thing you could do. Not a bad thing to
have a <i>fidus Achates</i> born a Trojan. Put you up
to their wiles. Shouldn't wonder if he'd given you a
hand as it is?"</p>

<p>"Now I come to think of it, he <em>did</em> once. We
were having some brisk work that day at Katikara,
where we couldn't dislodge the natives from the
redoubt. The firing was sharp, when he motioned
me to change position. The next minute a bullet
struck the tree just where I had been standing, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>

a fellow put his head over the parapet to see if he
had bagged me. Warwick was waiting for him, and
as he fired I saw my friend fling up his arms and
fall backward."</p>

<p>"'Close call!' as the backwoodsmen say; but that
sort of thing's all luck. Look at Ropata! You'd
think he stood up on purpose to be shot at&mdash;shilling
a shot kind of business. Never been touched yet.
No wonder they call him 'Waha Waha.' 'The devil
or some untoward saint' has an eye to him, the
Tohungas say."</p>

<p>"He's a grand soldier. It's lucky for us that
he's on our side. Reckless and ruthless, a true
Ngatiporou.&mdash;Hallo! what tribe do you belong to?"
continued he, as he pointed to a tall Maori standing
within a few paces of them. "Why, it's Warwick!
How in the world did you get so close to us without
our hearing you?"</p>

<p>"Only in the way some Waikato will sneak <em>you</em>,
lieutenant, if you are not more careful&mdash;when you'll
be shot before you have time to lift your hand. My
native relatives taught me that and other things
when I was young."</p>

<p>"And what news have you? Anything important?"</p>

<p>"That's as it may be. Large bodies of the
Ngaiterangi have commenced to move forward towards
the Orakau. We shall have a big affair soon.
I fell in with a scout of the Arawa named Taranui,
and he was of the same way of thinking. Said the
Ngaiterangi were closing up. But I must deliver my
report at headquarters first."</p>

<p>Whereupon Warwick departed. He had divested

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>

himself of his European garments, and was attired
chiefly in a flax mat (<i>pureke</i>), a <i>tapona</i> (war-cloak),
and other strictly Maori habiliments, with a <i>heitiki</i>
suspended from his neck; his muscular arms and
lower leg were bare. He looked so like a native
that only by close inspection could he be detected.</p>

<p>"The gods be praised!" said Mr. Slyde, fervently.
"Men getting mouldy here. Another month or two
like this would demoralize them. Out of hand a
trifle already. Look at Warwick! Doesn't he glide
along, at that half run, half walk of the natives? At
this distance no one would take him for a white man.
Have all the news when he comes to supper."</p>

<p>With this hope before them, the friends addressed
themselves to such occupations as were available, and
awaited the evening meal, when Warwick would have
an opportunity of unloading his budget. When the
bugle-call sounded the welcome invitation, they
descried him lounging down from the other end of
the camp in undress uniform, having taken the opportunity
to remove every trace of his recent experiences.</p>

<p>"And now for your adventures, Warwick," said
Massinger, as, having settled to the after-supper pipe,
the little party seated themselves on a rude bench
constructed of fern stems some ten feet in length, and
supported on blocks of the pahautea. "It doesn't
happen to rain now, wonderful to relate, and the
moon, taking heart and encouragement, 'diffuses her
mild rays,' as the poets say, through this ancient
and darksome woodland. Did you see any of the
Ngaiterangi?"</p>

<p>"I did indeed, nearer than I liked," answered
Warwick; "and but for a lucky chance they would

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>

have seen me, in which case <em>you</em> would never have
seen me again&mdash;alive that is."</p>

<p>"Thrilling in the extreme," assented Mr. Slyde.
"What was it&mdash;a <i>taua</i>?"</p>

<p>"More than that; a whole <i>hapu</i>&mdash;a strong one
too, women and all. They were travelling fast, and
heading straight for Kihikihi."</p>

<p>"How far off were you?"</p>

<p>"Barely sixty yards. What saved me was that I
was in the bed of a creek, among the ferns on the
edge of the water. I had just been going to climb
to the top, when I heard a girl laugh. I could scarcely
believe my ears. However, I crawled up and peeped
through the manuka. Sure enough, there they were,
three hundred strong, besides women and children&mdash;marching
in close order, too. If they had straggled at
all I was a gone man."</p>

<p>"So they didn't see you?"</p>

<p>"No. What saved me was a bend in the creek,
which they had crossed higher up; so they steered
for the other point which they could see&mdash;there are
some rocks on the bank&mdash;and left me in the loop of
the circle. If they had struck the creek nearer to
me, I must have been seen. But they had camped
at the other point, and having had their <i>kai</i>, were
marching to recover the time. I was very glad when
I saw their backs."</p>

<p>"How long would they be in reaching Kihi-kihi?"</p>

<p>"Not before tomorrow night. Their intention
is, of course, to get into Orakau and strengthen the
defences. There's only a sufficient number there now
to hold the earthworks against a moderate force."</p>

<p>"What do you think the general will do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Move to intercept them before they can get into
the pah."</p>

<p>"And is there time for the march?"</p>

<p>"Barely. Don't be surprised if we have the order
to start at daylight. I went back on their trail for
the rest of that day, and found that they had only
made one halt, having come right through from
Maungatautari. Just at nightfall I picked up the
tracks of Taranui, and got to his camp, in a cave
that I knew all about."</p>

<p>"Then you compared notes?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He says it will be the biggest fight of the
war; that Waka Nene and Patuone were on the march,
with every warrior of the Ngapuhi and the Rarawa.
Mannering and Waterton were with them, also Erena.
Taranui said she never leaves her father. There were
many other women, which makes me think that it is
a more serious affair than usual."</p>

<p>"Why should that be?" asked Massinger, heroically
concealing his personal interest in this phase of the
expedition.</p>

<p>"Because they do not care to leave them at home.
They have a notion that in case of defeat the Waikatos
might double back and raid their villages."</p>

<p>"What an absurd idea! Surely they can't imagine
that, with the forces at our command, such a thing
could be possible!"</p>

<p>"Such things <em>have</em> happened in old days," said
Slyde. "Defeated tribe suffered horrors unspeakable.
Ngapuhis felt no hesitation in inflicting when they
were uppermost. Tribal custom. No grounds of
complaint if they receive same in turn."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, there's no slavery now; otherwise,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>

said Warwick, "one could hardly describe the condition
of a conquered tribe. The missionaries may be
thanked for that. I have heard tales that would
make your hair stand on end."</p>

<p>"Much worse than could happen now?" asked
Massinger.</p>

<p>"Worse&mdash;worse a hundredfold. First of all, the
old and helpless would be killed and eaten&mdash;yes, <em>eaten</em>
before their blood was cold. Any particular family
among the captors that had lost relatives would have
men or women handed over to them to torture at
their pleasure; and great pleasure it seemed to be
to prolong the agony and refine the cruelty. All the
able-bodied men and women would be carried off as
slaves&mdash;not only to be used as beasts of burden, but
to be held degraded for life as having been slaves.
Their lot was a hard one, though occasionally some
lived through it, and were now and then freed. Others
became distinguished, like Te Waharoa."</p>

<p>"I have heard his history," said Massinger. "What
a remarkable man he must have been!"</p>

<p>"He was indeed. Found crying, a small child,
among the ruins of his pah at Wanganui, and carried
away to Rotorua by Pango, a chief of the Ngatiwhakane,
who in after-years piously repented (in
1836) that he had not there and then ended the life
of one fated to become the destroyer of his tribe. It
did seem ungrateful when he, forty years afterwards,
declared war against the tribe that had liberated him,
and slaughtered them wholesale at Ohinemutu."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Sleep did not appear to be likely to visit Massinger
after what he had heard from Warwick. Long after

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>

his comrades had retired he remained on watch, gazing
into the forest, as if he expected the Ngapuhi to
debouch thence, with Mannering and Waterton at the
head of their warriors, and Erena beside her father, a
warrior-maid too proud to remain behind when the
great Ngapuhi tribe was on the war-path.</p>

<p>What would be the fate of this strange girl, so
subtly compounded of diverse elements, the twin
natures within her&mdash;the forest life and the civilized&mdash;each
struggling for the mastery?</p>

<p>And what were his feelings now with respect to
her? Could he deny that her image was constantly
in his thoughts; that the recollection of her haughty,
graceful bearing, her superb form, her lustrous eyes,
her radiant smile, combined to form a picture dangerously
enthralling? From one fateful syren, so
destructive to his peace, his every aim and prospect
in life, he had been removed. And now, must a newer
"phantom of delight" reappear to disturb his faculties
and assail his reason? Whatever might be the result,
one thing was certain&mdash;his heart swelled with unwonted
emotion at the thought of seeing her again.</p>

<p>And under what circumstances were they once
more to meet? Not under the fern-arched glades of
that enchanted forest, wherein they had wandered
side by side so many a mile, carelessly gay as the
bird that called above them, looking forward but to
the halt by rushing stream or fire-lit camp, amid the
silent splendours of the antarctic night. He had
thought to regard this fantastic friendship as one of
the inevitable episodes of a roving life, productive,
doubtless, of a transient series of pleasurable emotions
and interesting experiences, but to be disengaged from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>

his career when serious action was demanded, like
the drifting weeds and flowers that for a time impede
the flowing tide.</p>

<p>How many men have so judged! How many
have discovered that the fragile bonds, to be cast
aside as pleasure or interest might dictate, have
changed mysteriously into shackles and fetters that
hold with inflexible tenacity a long life through?</p>

<p>But who thus argues in the halcyon days of
youthful dalliance, when reason is stilled, and every
natural feeling exults in joyous possession of the
magical hours? The sky is blue and golden, the
birds sing, strains of unearthly melody float through
the charmed air&mdash;immortal, enthralling. Care is
defied, sorrow banished. The "vengeance due for all
our wrongs" is immeasurably distant. Yet Nemesis&mdash;slow-footed
sleuth-hound of Fate&mdash;is rarely evaded.</p>

<p>A train of depressing reflections may probably
have arisen in his midnight musings, not wholly to be
disregarded, sanguine as was his nature. But he comforted
himself as a last resource with the idea that
there was a chance of his being knocked over in the
coming engagement, which promised to be of a yet
more bloody and obstinate nature than those in which
he had already taken part. Having thus arrived at
some sort of a conclusion, if not wholly satisfactory,
he disposed himself to a slumber from which the
bugle-notes of the reveillé only aroused him.</p>

<p>The march had been arranged on the calculation
that they would reach Orakau, where the enemy would
in all probability join the hostile forces in sufficient
time to intercept them, and so destroy the strength
of the combination. The order of the day, therefore,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>

required a continuous march until sundown, after
which a halt for refreshment would take place.</p>

<p>The troops would then continue the advance until
daylight under the guidance of trusted scouts, of
whom Warwick was the leader and interpreter. They
would then, it was hoped, be enabled to fall upon the
Ngaiterangi unprepared, and deal one of the most
decisive blows of the war, besides capturing the
Orakau pah, a stronghold of great strength in itself,
and the key to a most important position. Artillery,
too, would be brought to bear on the pah for breaching
purposes. The full strength of the Ngapuhi and
Rarawa would also be available. All things looked
like an assured victory.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> in one hemisphere Roland Massinger was
revolving these momentous questions concerning love,
duty, happiness, in this world and the next, Hypatia
Tollemache was considering almost equally important
decisions at the other end of the world.</p>

<p>Her range of thought and feeling was by no means
so comprehensive as his, inasmuch as, by adhering to
the strict line of duty embodied in altruistic sacrifice,
she had considerably narrowed the field of argument.
She had definitely abandoned the idea of "slum
missionary" effort, having discovered by experience
what had been previously suggested to her, that there
is an unpleasant, even undesirable, side to these
ministrations when the evangelist is a young and
handsome woman.</p>

<p>She saw clearly that there were many worthy
labourers in that vineyard who, possessing equal zeal,
did not suffer from such disqualifications. The illness
which she had contracted when weakened by overwork,
possibly through infection, had chilled her enthusiasm,
perhaps caused her to doubt the expediency of her
mission.</p>

<p>She was on the point of reviewing the respective

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>

conditions of missionary life in China and Hindostan,
where the Zenana offered so fair a field for reformation
by cultured sisterhoods, when she received a
letter from her friend Mary Summers, the interpretation
of which was, to Hypatia's sympathetic spirit,
"Come over and help us."</p>

<p>With Mary Summers she had long since formed
a close friendship. They had corresponded regularly
since her departure to New Zealand as the wife of
the Reverend Cyril Summers. He had been a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>
of Bishop Selwyn, and, as a curate, a favourite attendant
during the long, quasi-dangerous journeys in which the
soul of that latter-day apostle delighted.</p>

<p>As often happens in friendships, and even closer
intimacies, the schoolfellows were strongly contrasted
in appearance and disposition. The one was tall and
fair, with grey-blue eyes, which could flash on occasion.
An air of hauteur, chastened by philosophic
self-repression, distinguished her. The other was
scarce of middle height, with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</i> but perfect
figure, dark hair, and wistful hazel eyes.</p>

<p>Hypatia was impetuous, disdainful of obstacles,
hating the expedient, and scorning danger. Mary
was persuasive, self-effacing, soft of speech and
manner, of a goodness so pervading that it seemed
an impertinence to praise it. Many people were
strengthened in their convictions as to a future state
by the belief that any such scheme must include
a heaven for Mary Summers.</p>

<p>She and her husband had encountered trials and
privations, borne unflinchingly. They had reached a
moderate degree of success, and, so to speak, prosperity,
having come to inhabit a comfortable cottage near

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>

Tauranga, when this lamentable war bade fair to ruin
everything, destroying the work of years, and even
endangering their safety.</p>

<p>The epistle which decided Hypatia as to locality
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">My dearest Hypatia</span>,</p>

<p>"Wars and alarms still prevail, I grieve to
say. The colonists are determined, and the natives
desperate, each race fighting as if for existence. Blood
has been shed on either side, so that all hope of
peace or mediation is at an end. I do not give any
opinion as to the policy of the Government. My
husband believes that an act of injustice provoked
the contest which led to the war. The side on which
the fault lay has a heavy account to settle. But now
all agree that unless the natives make unconditional
submission there is no hope of peace.</p>

<p>"And how terrible are the consequences! It is
positively heartbreaking to see the dispersion of native
schools, the empty churches, and to hear of promising
pupils and converts in the ranks of the enemy&mdash;though
they have not unlearned, poor things, all that we have
been at such pains to teach them. Continually we
hear of acts of humanity performed by them while
fighting bravely in their own ranks. Poor Henare
Taratoa went under fire to fetch water for a wounded
soldier in the trenches at the Gate Pah. He himself
was killed soon afterwards at Orakau.</p>

<p>"It is affecting to hear, as we did, from a man in
active service, of their reading the lessons of the day
and singing their psalms in the intervals of the hottest
fighting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"These were once our <em>friendly</em> natives, many of
whom we know well by name. They will not fight
on Sunday, or break the Sabbath in any way, which is
more than our troops can say. Though at times downhearted
and anxious, Cyril and I feel that we have
enjoyed a high privilege in doing our Master's work.</p>

<p>"As to position, we are certainly not too far from
the seat of war, but Cyril says they have not as yet
harmed any of the missionaries. Outlying settlers
have been murdered, and one poor family&mdash;but I
cannot bear to think of the details.</p>

<p>"We are in God's hands. So far we have been
shielded from evil. We are steadfast in faith and
trust in the power of our Redeemer. The children
and Cyril are well. If only I were a little stronger,
and servants were not things of the past, I should be
<em>nearly</em> quite happy. Always (in peace or war)</p>

<p class="p15">"Your devoted friend,</p>
<p class="p20">"<span class="smcap">Mary Summers</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Poor dear Mary! Nearly <em>quite</em> happy indeed!
Just like her to think of every one but herself. 'If
she were only a little stronger!' No servant, too;
and here am I, Hypatia Tollemache, as strong as
ever I was, now that I have got over that horrid fever;
safe, protected, in luxury even, only disturbed by
the thought of where I shall betake myself with my
gifts and endowments (such as they are), and all
uncertain of what good I shall do when I get there.
From 'India to the Pole' seems prophetic. I
was nearly going to India; now shall I go to the
'Pole'? Yes, I am resolved. Writing to and condoling
with poor dear Mary will be saying in effect,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>

'Be ye warmed and fed'&mdash;the lowest hypocrisy of all,
it always seemed to me. I am determined&mdash;that is
to say, I have fully made up my mind. I will go
out and help poor Mary, the Reverend Cyril, and the
dear children, besides taking my turn with the heathen,
unless they bring their tomahawks to church. It will
be a charity worthy of the name. There can be no
mortal doubt about that. As for the danger, do they
not share it? So can I. <em>That</em> never put me off anything,
I can safely say. I shall write to Mary <em>when</em>
I have taken my passage&mdash;not before."</p>

<p>So fixed in the resolve to offer up herself on the
altar of friendship, duty, and danger delightfully
combined was this latter-day damsel, that she went
off to London, and, having no parents or near relatives
to control her&mdash;only a couple of trustees, who,
provided she did not spend more than her income,
permitted her to do pretty well as she pleased&mdash;took
her passage to New Zealand by the very next boat,
the <i>Arawatta</i>. The said trustees raised their eyebrows
when informed of her intention, but consoled themselves,
being men of sense and experience, remarking
that if young women of independent means and ideas
did not do one foolish thing they would be sure to
do another, even perhaps less desirable. So, the
decisive step being taken, she had only to tell a few
friends&mdash;Mrs. Merivale, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Branksome, being one&mdash;and
get ready a suitable outfit for the voyage to this
Ultima Thule of Maoriland.</p>

<p>Up to this time, though hard knocks, hard fare,
and hard marches had convinced Massinger that
volunteer soldiering in Northern New Zealand was
no child's play, yet, on the whole, the experience had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>

been less depressing than exciting. The health of
the triumvirate was unimpaired. The youth and
uniformly good spirits of Massinger had served him
well. Mr. Slyde's pessimistic philosophy had much
the same effect, apparently, leading him to assert that
"nothing mattered one way or another in this infernal
country; that all things being as bad as they could
be, any change would probably be for the better;
that if they were killed in action, as seemed highly
probable, it would be perhaps the best and quickest
way out of the hopeless muddle into which the
Governor, the ministers, the settlers, and the soldiers
had got the cursed country. The alternative was, of
course, to desert, which, for absurdly conventional
reasons, could not be thought of. His advice to Massinger
was to marry Erena Mannering and join the
Ngapuhi tribe, which, under Waka Nene's sagacious
policy, was bound to come out on top. That
would be, at any rate, a decided policy, such as no
party in the island had sufficient intellect to grasp.
He might then give all his support to the King
movement, and possibly in course of time be elected
Sovereign of Waikato and surrounding states, do the
Rajah Brooke business, and found an Anglo-Maori
dynasty."</p>

<p>These and similar suggestions, delivered with an
air of earnestness, and the slow persuasive tones which
marked his ordinary conversation, never failed to
produce a chorus of merriment, in effective contrast
to the unrelaxing gravity of his expression.</p>

<p>As for Warwick, the war-demon which had possessed
his Maori ancestors had temporarily taken up
its abode with him, for, as the campaign progressed,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>

he seemed day by day to be more resolute and
unflinching, in action or out of it.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," said Mr. Slyde, as they commenced
their march in the discouraging dawn of a dismally
damp day, "we're in for a deucedly hot picnic. Colonel
been blocked two or three times in his advance;
made up his mind to go for this Orakau pah, spite
of all odds. Hope he won't start before he's ready.
Pluck and obstinacy fine things in their place, but the
waiting business pays best with Tangata Maori.
Devilish cool hand at the game himself."</p>

<p>"How about our artillery?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"Not weight enough, fellows say. Guns always
beastly bother to transport. See when we get there."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Another scout had just come in with the news
that Paterangi had been abandoned, and that
Brigadier-General Carey was in force at Awamutu.
The Ngati Maniapoto had crossed the Puniu river,
and at Orakau one of the chiefs had shouted out,
"This is my father's land; here will I fight." Rifle-pits
were formed, and a determined stand was resolved
upon. Before the position, however, could be strongly
fortified, three hundred men of the 40th Regiment
had been sent to occupy the rear. At three o'clock
next morning a force of seven hundred men, artillery
and engineers, the 40th and 60th Regiments, marched
past the Kihi-kihi redoubt, picking up a hundred and
fifty men from it on the way. The Waikato, the
65th and 3rd Militia, with a hundred men, moved
up from Rangi-ohia to the east side. At day-dawn
thirteen hundred rank and file had converged upon
Orakau, strengthened by a contingent of the Forest

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>

Rangers, among whom were Messrs. Massinger, Slyde,
and Warwick, expectant of glory, and by no means
uncertain as to taking part in one of the most stubborn
engagements they had as yet encountered. The defenders
of Orakau numbered under four hundred, inclusive
of women and children.</p>

<p>"There goes the big gun from the south-west
ridge," said Slyde. "It ought to make the splinters
fly. A breach is only a matter of time."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what time?" asked Warwick. "I don't
know Rewi, if he hasn't blinded the outer lines with
fern-bundles tied with flax. It's wonderful how they
will stop a cannon-ball. Yes, I thought so. No
making for a breach just yet."</p>

<p>"They can't have any food or water to speak of,"
said Slyde. "Have to give in if we wait."</p>

<p>"True enough; they're short of water, and have
only potatoes and gourds, I hear," said Warwick.
"But Maoris can live upon little, and fight upon
nothing at all."</p>

<p>"There goes Captain King and the advanced
guard," said Slyde.</p>

<p>"Too soon&mdash;too soon!" said Warwick. "There's
a devilish deep ditch, besides earthworks and timber.
Ha! there the Maori speaks. The troops have made
a rush; they're driven back. The reinforcement
comes up. Another assault. My God! Captain
King's down&mdash;badly wounded, I know. See, Captain
Baker has dismounted, and calls for volunteers.
Rangers to the front! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>And like one man, the little band joined the
18th. But though the assault was made with
desperate courage, the close fire again forced them

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>

to retire with a heavy loss. No breach had as yet
been made, while the fire from behind the earthworks
was incessant and accurate.</p>

<p>Seeing that it was not a case for a cheer and a
bayonet rush, the general decided to take the place
by sap.</p>

<p>"Might have thought of that before," growled
Mr. Slyde, "and saved my hat." Here he pointed
to a bullet-hole in his headpiece with so rueful a
face that his smoke-begrimed comrades burst out
laughing. "Are <em>you</em> hit, Warwick?"</p>

<p>"Only a graze," replied he, feeling his right arm,
from which the blood had stained his sleeve. "I was
afraid the bone was touched. It's all right."</p>

<p>"Here come those Maunga-tautari fellows," said
Warwick, pointing to a compact body of natives now
appearing on the scene. "Ha! you may fire a volley
and dance the war-dance, my fine fellows; you're out
of this game. There goes a shell among them. How
they scatter! Too late for this play."</p>

<p>So it proved. Within the next twenty-four hours
a British reinforcement, four hundred strong, appeared.
The sap had been carried on; none could escape.
Another day, another night, passed. At length, about
noon, an Armstrong gun was carried into the sap, a
breach was made, and the siege was virtually over.</p>

<p>On the score of humanity, women and children
being in the pah, the garrison was called upon to
surrender, with a promise that their lives should be
spared.</p>

<p>Now was heard the immortal rejoinder: "Ka
whai-whai, tonu&mdash;ake&mdash;ake&mdash;ake!" ("We will fight
on to the end&mdash;for ever&mdash;for ever&mdash;for ever!")</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>The interpreter pleaded for the women and children.
"Why not send them out?"</p>

<p>The answer came back: "Our women will fight
also."</p>

<p>But they commenced to find the rifle-pits untenable.
The hand-grenades made terrific slaughter. The rifle-pits
had been too hastily formed for safety; but still
they fought stubbornly on.</p>

<p>When the assault was made, half of the first troops
that entered fell; nor was the second assault more
fortunate. Then the enemy's ammunition failed. It
was pathetic to note them in their deep despair.
Standing amid their dead and dying, the blood-stained
warriors sang a mission hymn of old days, and raised
their voices&mdash;which were plainly heard&mdash;in passionate
supplication to the Christian's God.</p>

<p>"But there was no voice, nor any that answered."
Still pressed nearer, with hail of shot and shell, the
resistless pakeha. Once again their mood changed,
and they turned to the heathen gods of the children
of Maui. Chanting an ancient <i>karakia</i>, or imprecation,
they marched forth in a solid column. The women
and children, with the high chiefs, were placed in the
centre.</p>

<p>An opening had been made in the ranks to enable
the heavy gun to open fire. Through this, in the full
light of the afternoon sun, the unconquered garrison
marched out steadily, as if going to church in the
peaceful days of missionary rule. Rewi ordered that
no shot should be fired. The scanty ammunition
would be all needed for the marsh passage, on the
route to the Puniu river.</p>

<p>Like the Moorish monarch giving his last sigh to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>

the glories of the Alhambra and the snow-crowned
Sierras, did Rewi cast a lingering look on his ancestral
possessions? Eastward frowned Maunga-tautari, on
the flank of the great Waikato plain. Pirongi on the
west held watch and ward over the Waipu. Kihi-kihi,
his own settlement, was in the hands of the
pakeha. But, the Puniu once crossed, there was refuge
in the forests of Rangitoto.</p>

<p>The marsh was reached, though many fell before
the converging fire of the troops. The cavalry
intercepted them at the neck. Many were thus
slain; but, in spite of all losses, the main body gained
the Puniu river and escaped, after a pursuit lasting
over six miles.</p>

<p>Orakau had fallen; of the garrison, nearly one
half lay dead around the pah or on the Puniu river
trail. How stubborn a fight had they made for three
days and two nights against fearful odds, short as
they became of food, water, and ammunition! The
sap had reached the last ditch. Even then they did
not despair. They might die, but would not yield.
Maunga-tautari was abandoned. Rewi's warriors
were scattered. It was the Maori Flodden; and the
crossing of the Puniu was akin to that of the historic
river, immortalized in the verse of the Magician of
the North&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Orakau business should finish up the infernal
war, any one would think," said Mr. Slyde on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>

the following morning, when, after a decent night's rest,
a complete personal renovation, and a breakfast, much
assisted by the arrival of fresh supplies, he and Massinger
were cleaning their accoutrements.</p>

<p>"But surely it <em>will</em> end it," replied Massinger,
with an air of conviction. "More than a hundred
natives were found dead. It is almost certain that
fifty more were either killed or mortally wounded.
The rest are scattered. They will never be so mad
as to tackle the troops we can bring against them
now, engineers and artillery too, besides the volunteers
and friendlies."</p>

<p>"Any other country, any other people, quite so,"
assented Mr. Slyde, in a tone of philosophical argument;
"but Maoris devils incarnate when their blood
is up. Remember what Tutakaro said, chaffed with
fighting against us once and for us afterwards?"</p>

<p>"No. I saw the man, though&mdash;fine, powerful
youngster."</p>

<p>"Beggar coolly replied, 'What matter? Fighting
is fighting: if we young fellows can get a share of it,
don't much care which side we go for.'"</p>

<p>"And did he go well for us?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did. Killed a chief. Shot through
the arm, too. Tied it up and blazed away till the
affair was over."</p>

<p>"What a splendid mercenary soldier he would
have made in the Middle Ages! Is he with us now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Very nearly got Rewi, as he was crossing
the mound. Strictly impartial."</p>

<p>"And a most pathetic sight it was" said Massinger,
"when they were crossing the mound at the other
side of the swamp. I saw the column file by&mdash;men,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>

women, and children, all as serious as a funeral, and as
cool as if they were going to market. I hadn't the
heart to fire another shot. Every now and then I
could hear a woman's voice&mdash;not complaining, far from
it&mdash;urging on the men to keep going and to shoot
when they saw a chance."</p>

<p>"Warwick says <em>you</em> had a close shave. So much
for not minding your business. Thinking about
Erena Mannering. Soldiers no right to have feelings.
Harass the enemy, sink, burn, kill, destroy. Navy
regulations; army too."</p>

<p>"Certainly a bullet <em>did</em> hit the tree I was leaning
against, close to my head. Queer thing, too; it came
from the <em>friendly</em> side. I distinctly saw the smoke
from the bush, where our natives were."</p>

<p>"You must have been in the line of fire."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort. It was a side shot."</p>

<p>"Any one cherishing ill feeling that you know of?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no. Now I come to think, there was an
ill-looking dog of a Ngapuhi with us at Rotorua, that
was turned out of the party by me and bullied by
the chief. His name was Ngarara."</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;ew! I've heard the reptile's name before.
Cousin or something of your Zenobia&mdash;admirer
probably. Acute attack jealousy."</p>

<p>"Might have been. After he went I didn't trouble
my head about him. I had a great mind to give him
a thrashing, but Warwick said it might cause trouble."</p>

<p>"And so at any time he may take a steady pot-shot
at you; probably did. 'Keep your eye skinned,'
as that Yankee said. Set Warwick at him. By the
way, wonder how he is? Shot through the shoulder
yesterday. No bone hit. Doctor says all right directly.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>

Lay up for a week. Painful all the same. Suppose
we look him up?"</p>

<p>When our friends were comforting themselves
with the belief that perhaps the dragging and unsatisfactory
war was near its termination, how little
they were aware of the decisive engagement ahead
of them&mdash;the very next in succession, as it turned
out, when the 43rd was fated to lose more officers
than any of the regiments engaged at Waterloo!
A crushing repulse, followed by a disastrous rout
and the death of their gallant colonel! With what
indignation would they have repelled such a suggestion!
It was destined to come to pass, nevertheless. That
two of the speakers would be dangerously wounded,
and the other at death's door&mdash;"reported missing,"
besides? Long was it before the soldiers of the
gallant regiment, which had won glory on many a
bloody field, could endure an allusion to the Gate
Pah, a name which always brought up memories of
bitter grief and shame intolerable. It was a case of
"threes about"&mdash;those simple, apparently meaningless
words, spoken by chance or otherwise&mdash;which clouded
the well-earned fame of a gallant cavalry regiment
in India, and caused the death of their colonel by
his own hand. And in the memorable disaster at the
Gate Pah, in the moment of victory, it is alleged that
the ominous word, to a British ear, of "Retreat!" was
distinctly heard.</p>

<p>Orakau fight was over. The dead were buried.
The women were still mingling blood with their tears
for those who would never more defy the pakeha or
their hereditary enemies. But the national war-spirit
was alive and redly glowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the Ngaiterangi and other natives had
gone from Hawkes Bay to Tauranga, indignant at
the blockade of the coast. Major Whitmore, as a
counter-stroke, raised a contingent from among the
friendly natives, confident of their willingness to
fight anybody and anywhere. His opinion did not
long lack confirmation.</p>

<p>The Ngaiterangi speedily changed position,
building a strong pah at Puke-hina-hina, long
afterwards memorable as the Gate Pah, so named
from its peculiar situation on a narrow ridge with a
swamp at each end. It was about three miles from
the mission station at Tauranga. Here the insurgents
proposed to await the attack. Not unused to the
rules of war, they sent a protocol (March 28) to the
colonel in command, announcing that unarmed persons,
or even soldiers who turned the butt of their muskets
or the hilt of their swords to the enemy, would be
spared. This resolve was fated to stand them in good
stead.</p>

<p>On the 21st of April, General Cameron transferred
his headquarters to Tauranga.</p>

<p>"'Quem Jupiter vult perdere dementat prius,'"
spouted Massinger, who saw an opening for a classical
quotation as, soon after daybreak on the 29th, the
guns and mortars, placed in position overnight,
opened fire in front. "What possible chance do
they think they have against a park of artillery and
nearly two thousand men?"</p>

<p>"'Let not him that putteth on his armour, etcetera,'"
returned Slyde. "If I were anything but a
thick-witted Englishman, I should say, don't like the
look of things. Maoris too d&mdash;&mdash;d quiet. Bad sign.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>

See that fellow coolly shovelling up earth to fill a
hole."</p>

<p>Warwick, whose wound was presumably paining
him, but who defied the surgeon to keep him in the
hospital, said nothing. Afterwards brightening up,
he began in his usual cool way to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>"We've got guns enough <em>this</em> time to pound
them to bits, and men enough to eat them, but
they'll make a fight of it, and a stiff one. That
redoubt's an artful piece of work, and the line of
rifle-pits between it and the swamp is well placed.
More than the flagstaff is&mdash;for <i>us</i>, I mean. I
believe it's ever so far in the rear to draw the fire.
That's an old dodge of theirs. However, there must
be a breach in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I should say before that; the firing's very
accurate," said Massinger. "And that Armstrong
six-pounder is enfilading their left."</p>

<p>"After lunch, if we get any," quoth Slyde.</p>

<p>Whatever "stomach for the fight" the men told
off for the assault had, the ration served out to the
Forest Rangers, who were notified for that service,
along with a hundred and fifty sailors and marines
and the same number of the 43rd, was discussed with
appetite. A reserve of three hundred men, under
Captain Hamilton of H.M.S. <i>Esk</i>, formed the reserve.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"The cannon's loud-mouthed summons ceased,</span>
      <span class="i2">A rocket signal soared on high."</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The assault was on.</p>

<p>Colonel Booth and Commander Hay led the way
into the inner trench, where no enemy was to be
seen. But from earth-covered pits and passages
poured forth a volley, under which officers and men

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>

fell rapidly. Still the crowd of assailants pressed on,
only to be shot down as they entered the fatal death-trap.
The reserve joined, with headlong rush, in
support of their comrades&mdash;all vainly, as it seemed.
The officers of both services continued to drop, but
the ranks closed up&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"Each stepping where his comrade stood,</span>
      <span class="i2">The instant that he fell."</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Captain Hamilton fell in his place when leading
the reserve. Colonel Booth and Commander Hay
had fallen before. Captains Hamilton, Glover, Mure,
Utterton, and two lieutenants, <em>all of the 43rd</em>, were
shot dead or mortally wounded, as also Captain
Glover's brother, whom he tried to carry off. The
front ranks of the storming party were annihilated.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes every officer of the column
was either dead or wounded. Among the latter were
Slyde and Warwick. They had gone down along
with the officers of the 43rd. When they awoke to
consciousness it was dark, and their comrade Massinger
was nowhere to be seen or heard.</p>

<p>Stunned and panic-stricken, deprived of their
officers, the men had broken and fled&mdash;in such headlong
haste that they took no advantage of the
ground. On the open surface of the ridge, many
were shot. No one could account for the disaster.
Some said that the word "Retreat" was heard and
acted upon; others, that the main body of the
natives had rushed to the rear, and being met by the
68th Regiment posted there, recoiled, and dashing
back to sell their lives dearly, were mistaken by the
soldiers for a Maori reinforcement. Then the Maori
warriors turned to the work of slaughter. Rawiri

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>

leaped on to the parapet as he fired, taunting the
soldiery and inviting them to renew the fight. As
the day declined, the garrison made a determined
rush to the right wing of the pah. During the
darkness of the night they stole away in small parties.
They passed silently through the fern, or by the right
rear, leaving (and this was most exceptional) their
dead and wounded behind them.</p>

<p>In the garrison fought all day Henare Taratoa,
educated under Bishop Selwyn at St. John's College
before 1853. He tended one of the wounded, who
in his dying agonies thirsted for a drop of water.
The Maoris had none. Taratoa threaded his way
through the English sentries in the darkness, and
returned with a calabash of water to slake his
enemy's thirst. More than that. By the side of
each wounded Englishman was found in the morning
some small water-vessel, placed there by the Maoris
before they deserted the fort.</p>

<p>Colonel Booth was carried out of the pah in the
morning. The general went to him, but the gallant
soldier felt the repulse so deeply that he turned away
his face, saying, "General, I can't look at you. I
tried to carry out your orders, but we failed." He died
that evening.</p>

<p>The tameless islanders were not minded to give
up all for lost, even now. By one great effort they
might force back the invader, or possibly combine the
tribes against him. At any rate, in the quasi-victory
of the Gate Pah they had obtained <i>utu</i> for the death
of many a warrior, many a chief. But, even now, the
tribes were unbeaten. News came to Colonel Greer
from the Maori allies that yet another pah at Te

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>

Ranga was rising, a few miles from the scene of the
recent conflict.</p>

<p>Slyde and Warwick, severely though not dangerously
wounded, were both in hospital, precluded from participation
in the closing engagement, which they deeply
regretted. Lieutenant Massinger reported missing.</p>

<p>"Hard lines," said the former, raising himself with
difficulty from his stretcher, "not to have a throw in
at the finish. I feel convinced this must snuff the
beggars out. The colonel will at them before they
have time to do much. Friendlies in great heart.
The 43rd die to a man or wipe out their defeat."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Warwick, "I believe their hour is
come. How grieved Massinger will be that he is out
of it! However, he may think himself lucky to
escape with his life."</p>

<p>"You think he has, then?" said Slyde.</p>

<p>"He was all right when I saw him last, waving
his sword, shoulder to shoulder with Von Tempsky,
who was doing his best to rally the troops. Then I
went down. Saw nothing more. I had a crack with
the butt end of a tomahawk also. I have no doubt
that he is with Mannering's <i>hapu</i>, most likely with
Erena looking after him."</p>

<p>"In that case he's all right," said Slyde. "Maori
women great nurses, always heard."</p>

<p>"They've got a <i>tohunga</i> in the tribe," continued
Warwick, "the natives say, can cure any man that's
not actually buried&mdash;bring him to life, they believe.
Between him and Erena we'll see him back in
Auckland all right."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Colonel Greer made no delay at Te Ranga. He
marched at once with six hundred men, enfiladed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>

the enemy from a spur which commanded their
right; drove in their skirmishers and kept up a sharp
fire for two hours. Then, reinforced by a gun and
two hundred additional men, the advance was sounded.</p>

<p>Short work was made of the assault. The 43rd
and 68th, with the 1st Waikato, carried the rifle-pits
with a rush. For a short space the natives
fought desperately, then turned and fled, leaving
sixty-eight men dead in the rifle-pits. The pursuit
was keen. The 43rd avenged their losses at the
Gate Pah. One hundred and ten Maoris were killed,
twenty wounded, and ten made prisoners. Henare
Taratoa lay among the dead. On his body was
found a written order of the day. It began with
prayer, and ended with the words, "If thine enemy
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink."</p>

<p>Three stubbornly contested engagements had
broken the Maori power. In them they lost their
bravest warriors and nearly all their leading chiefs.
They had no option but to yield. On the 5th of
August the Governor, Sir George Grey, with General
Cameron, met the assembled tribes. They had previously
surrendered their arms to Colonel Greer, they
now surrendered their lands; upon which the Governor
promised to care for them as the Queen's subjects. He
would retain <em>one-fourth</em> of their lands as atonement
for the rebellion, but would return the remainder in
recognition of their humanity throughout the war.</p>

<p>The Waikato tribes had sustained a final and
crushing defeat. The flower of their race lay low,
were wounded or in prison. They had forfeited
their port at Tauranga, their most available outlet
for produce. The war was ended.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tollemache</span> had settled down at Oropi to the
performance of her daily duties, and, like Massinger,
commenced to discover that New Zealand was a most
interesting, not to say exciting, place of abode. After
completing her portion of the household work, which
she gladly took upon herself in order to spare her
friend's failing strength, she applied herself diligently
to the study of the Maori tongue and the historical
records of this newer Britain. The genial climate
and regular exercise acted upon her constitution so
favourably that she soon attained the fullest measure
of health and spirits. Never yet had she felt stronger
in mind and body, never yet so eager for opportunity
to devote herself to the good work spread so abundantly
before her. She was rewarded primarily by
noting the gradual improvement of Mrs. Summers'
health, and receiving the heartfelt thanks of the
Reverend Cyril, who, between domestic troubles, parochial
duties, and a natural apprehension of danger to
his defenceless household, sorely needed aid and
support. Such he found, in addition to intellectual
companionship, in the presence of this high-souled,
devoted maiden, whom he did not hesitate to say the
providence of God had sent to them in their distress.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>

As a school-friend of his wife's, a closer companionship
and more sympathetic intimacy was established than
could have been possible with any other inmate.
Would but this wretched war end, and a lasting peace
be established, he felt as if their future lot might be
one of almost unalloyed happiness.</p>

<p>As for Hypatia, her fearless, eager spirit, scornful
of obstacles and inglorious ease, rejoiced in the difficulties
of the position. After a laborious day's work,
during which she astonished the Maori handmaids by
the energy which she threw into her household tasks,
working in common with them, and eagerly possessing
herself of the vernacular, she pored over Maori
grammars and dictionaries with an ardour not inferior
to that which had secured her the unique academical
distinctions of her year. She learned the history, the
language, the manners and customs of the singular
people among whom she dwelt, with a rapidity which
astonished Mr. Summers, and caused him to remark to
his wife that he had been wont to consider the scholastic
triumphs of her friend somewhat exaggerated, but was
happy now to recant and apologize. Never before had
he seen a woman in whom were allied extraordinary
mental powers with such unflagging industry, steady
application with such brilliant conceptions. Sufficiently
rare among men, the combination was almost
unknown, in his experience, among women students.</p>

<p>"You have left out her beauty and her simplicity
of manner, my dear," said his wife, as she smiled up
at her husband's earnest face. "You generally remark
these attributes first, you know."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;most true," he said, relaxing his countenance.
"These I had forgotten. They make the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>

sum-total of high gifts in her case still more surprising.
For the most part beauties are neither clever nor
studious. Nor are the studious women beautiful.
Nature, in a fit of absence of mind, has split the
ingredients while fashioning her favourites, and given
Miss Tollemache a double allowance of good looks
with all the talents."</p>

<p>"Leaving some poor girl high and dry with neither,"
said Mrs. Summers. "You do see that occasionally.
Watch her there; she does not look like the top
mathematician of her year."</p>

<p>Nor did she, perhaps, to a superficial eye, as she
sat outside the detached building which served as a
kitchen, peeling potatoes, or rather scraping them,
native fashion, with a shell; afterwards placing them
in a wooden vessel shaped like a canoe for future
culinary treatment, the while in animated conversation
with Miru, a good-humoured, round-faced native girl,
whose peals of laughter were evoked from time to
time by her wonderful Maori sentences.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cyril Summers, "there she sits, suitably
dressed, yet looking like a society girl at a South
Kensington cookery class, perfectly at her ease with
Miru, who worships her, and yet doing the work that
is set before her thoroughly and efficiently."</p>

<p>"She takes the deepest interest in our converts,
too," said Mrs. Summers. "'One ought to prefer our
white heathen, of course,' she said to me the other
day, 'but I must confess they seem to me unutterably
inferior in manners, dignity, and truthfulness to this
race. Their ingrained selfishness and coarseness always
revolted me, in spite of my sense of duty. Now, these
people have all the simplicity and directness of nature.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>

Such courage, too! What tales we hear from the
front of their contempt of danger! They are, or
rather have been, cruel; but so have all nations in the
barbaric stage. We don't hear of anything but straightforward
fighting now, and that is easy to understand
when one looks around on this beautiful country.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I suppose it must have come sooner
or later. Yet when you contrast the old peaceful
mode of living&mdash;which I used to admire when we first
came here, and were not afraid to visit their kaingas&mdash;with
the present, one cannot but grieve. It was
the most perfect embodiment of the fabled Arcadian
life that could be imagined. The palisaded pah, at
once a fortress and a town, serving the purpose of
the feudal castle of the Middle Ages, to which the
inhabitants retreated in time of war; the fields and
gardens so neatly cultivated, the groups of women
and children, the young men and girls of the tribe,
the gossip, the laughter, the games and exercises, of
which they had a great variety; then our canoe trips
on the broad Waikato, or short boat excursions from
the coast settlements;&mdash;such pictures of natural rural
contentment, as superior to the ordinary life of common
Europeans as can be conceived."</p>

<p>"But then their wars&mdash;cruel and remorseless. Think
of Rauparaha and Hongi! Think of the wholesale
massacres, the cannibal feasts, the torturings, the
burnings!"</p>

<p>"No doubt. All these things were done in their
unregenerate days, but after the advent of that great
and good man, Marsden, in 1830, and the establishment
of missionary stations, these horrors gradually
lessened and were in process of dying out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you think that can be? Were there
not still tribal wars and ruthless massacres?"</p>

<p>"A state of conquest, succeeded by retribution,
could not be expected to cease suddenly. But you
may notice that as the old cannibal chiefs and leaders
died out, they in many instances recommended the
missionaries to their sons and successors. Then the
Christianized chiefs, like Waka Nene and Patuone,
never relapsed into heathenism, but fought for us and
with us to the end."</p>

<p>"Certainly that showed their power to assimilate
civilization, when once introduced."</p>

<p>"Then, again, one remarkable result of the progress
of religious teaching was their abolition of
slavery. The Maoris were large slaveholders in proportion
to their numbers. They made profitable use
of captives in agriculture and the laborious work of
the tribe. They pleased themselves also by feeling
that they had thus degraded their enemies. In the
case of chiefs and high-born women it was held to
be an unspeakable degradation, personal and political.
When one considers the difficulty of inducing civilized
nations to forego such privileges, one is lost in amazement
that a people but lately redeemed from barbarism
should act so humanely at the bidding of a handful
of missionaries. It was to forego an ancient institution
which contributed so largely to their pride and profit;
for slaves were valuable alike in peace and war."</p>

<p>Following up her researches and explorations in
Maori lore, Hypatia was daily more excited by the
wondrous revelations which the library of fact and
fiction furnished. A procession of warriors, orators,
poets, priests, and patriots passed before her eager

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>

vision. Conquerors who, like Timour and Zenghis
Khan, marched from one extremity of the island world
to the other, slaying and enslaving, devouring and
torturing, extirpating the weaker tribes&mdash;a devastating
wave of conquest.</p>

<p>Individuals, again, of such force of character and
fixity of resolve that they committed themselves to
the hazard of strange vessels, voyaging over unknown
seas in order to reach the wondrous isles at the world's
end, whence came these strong white strangers, who
bore such rich and rare, even terrible commodities,
to the children of Maui. Among these strong-souled
envoys the historic Hongi, who dissembled successfully,
while honoured in the midst of kings and courtiers,
until he procured possession of the first firearms,
after which he cast away the veneer of civilization,
and stood forth a second Attila, the remorseless
destroyer of his race. Not less, in peace or war, the
warrior and diplomatist, the Napoleon of his time,
the terrible Waharoa; risen from a slave's hard fate
and toilsome life through the mistaken lenity of his
captors, he exhibited his talents by devastating the lands
of neighbouring chiefs, and his gratitude by almost
obliterating the tribe which had protected him in youth
and set him free to commence his march of doom!</p>

<p>Strange to say, those remorseless despots, red with
the blood of their countrymen, and unsparing of the
lives of women and children, protected the missionaries.
Scorning to change their ancient faith, they yet threw
no impediment in the way of their successors becoming
Christians in name and faith, or loyal allies of the
white strangers.</p>

<p>The names of women, too, this earnest student

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>

found profusely associated with heroic deed and resolve,
such as have rendered individuals of the sex celebrated,
nay, immortal, since the dawn of history. Parallels
were there for all the legendary heroines. In the
revival of "Hero and Leander," it was the Maori
maiden, and not the lover, who dared the peril of
the midnight wave, and, more fortunate than he,
survived to form a happy union and earn the immortal
fame which still illumines the name of Hinemoa&mdash;that
name still celebrated, even though the fairy
terraces of Tarata charm the traveller no more, and
the magical fire-bordered lake, even Rotorua, be
whelmed in a cataclysm.</p>

<p>Mr. Summers was kept accurately informed by
his native converts of the progress of the war. He
heard details of the siege of Orakau in which the
little household was more than usually interested,
from the fact of Henare Taratoa and other converts
being in the enemy's ranks.</p>

<p>"Poor Henare!" said Mrs. Summers; "he was
our most promising scholar&mdash;gentle, brave, chivalrous,
the very embodiment of generosity. He no doubt
believes that he is fighting for his king and country
now that they have set up this fetish of Potatau. It
seems very hard, after all the trouble we took with
him and the others."</p>

<p>"And why should he <em>not</em> fight?" asked Hypatia,
with raised head and flashing eyes. "And&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">'How can man die better,</span>
      <span class="i2">When facing fearful odds?'</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The position is exactly that of Horatius. History
repeats itself. I, for one, do not wonder that any man
of his tribe, or woman either, should fight to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>

death in this quarrel. The more I learn about the
beginning of this lamentable war, the more I feel that
the authors of it must be condemned by impartial
observers."</p>

<p>"It cannot be logically defended," admitted Mr.
Summers; "and, personally, I deplore the inevitable
consequences, the temporary ruin of our hopes, the
destruction of our schools and churches, the arrest
of civilized progress. But some such conflict was
unavoidable."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Hypatia.</p>

<p>"The two races," answered he, "would never have
continued to live together in peace. The Maori
nature, proud, jealous, revengeful, holding themselves
to be the original owners of the country, the English
to be strangers and invaders, forbade a lasting peace.
They were unwilling to dispose of their lands&mdash;these
millions of fertile acres of which they made little
or no use. The colonizing Briton would never have
consented to stand idly by and see this great country,
fitted to be the home of millions of Anglo-Saxons
or other Europeans, held by a handful of barbarians."</p>

<p>"But how about the Divine command, 'Thou shalt
not steal,' 'Do unto others'&mdash;ordinances, the keeping
of which is enjoined upon individuals, but which are
so conveniently ignored by nations?"</p>

<p>"As a minister of the Gospel and a preacher of
the Word, I am compelled to admit that our national
policy and our national religion are often at variance.
Still, it cannot be denied that the advance of civilization
has mainly depended upon conquests and the
doctrine of force. In our own land the ancient Britons
were dispossessed by the Romans and the Iberian

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>

Celts; these, again, by Jutes and Saxons, who in
turn were conquered by the Normans. These people
found a weaker race, the Morioris, whom they slew
and enslaved. They nearly depopulated the South
Island, and would have wholly done so but for our
arrival. They have always acted upon, and perfectly
understand&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"That is intelligible," said Hypatia, with a sigh;
"but I must say I cannot help sympathizing with the
Maori Rangatira, in the spirit of the Douglas at
Tantallon moralizing over Marmion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not forget the poor wahines," said Mrs.
Summers. "Like all women in these affairs of state,
they seem to have the worst of it. Think of them at
Orakau, marching out of their blood-stained pah in
the midst of a hail of bullets, hungry, thirsty, perhaps
wounded, and yet, without doubt, they joined in the
defiant shout of '<em>Akore, akore, akore!</em>'"</p>

<p>"It was glorious," said Hypatia. "I could have
wished to have been there. It has immortalized them,
as well as the warriors among whom they fought. It
will re-echo through the ages long after the pahs are
grass-grown, or perhaps made into tea-gardens for the
coming race."</p>

<p>"That reminds me that it must be lunch-time,"
interposed Mrs. Summers, gently; and, with a half-reproachful

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>

gaze, the indignant advocate subsided,
and retired to her chamber.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Matters went on calmly and peacefully in this
lodge in the wilderness, disturbed but from time to
time with war rumours and tidings of siege or skirmish.
Occasionally a burst of weeping and dolorous long-drawn
lamentation in the Maori camp told that a
friend or kinsman had been added to the death-roll.
Then a former convert or pupil would stagger in,
wounded almost to the death, to be tended, and cured,
if such were possible, for no slightly wounded combatant
ever taxed the warm welcome of the Mikonaree
and his household. They were either sent away rejoicing
in their new-found strength and ability to level
a musket once more at the marauding pakeha, or, in
other case, were laid to rest in the mission graveyard,
comforted by the thought that the Burial Service
would be read over them by the good pakeha whom
they had learned to trust and revere.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when hope had departed, and they
began to count their remaining hours, they returned
to the lessons which had been with such care instilled
into them in the old peaceful days of the earlier missions.
They placed their trust in the mediation of Him
whom they connected with their conversion, and
recalled the weekly services and baptismal vows,
happy in the unshaken faith of youth, and passing
away to spirit-land without doubt or fear.</p>

<p>At other times, the warrior, roused to frenzy by
pain or despair, would solemnly renounce the stranger's
God and all His ways, and quit this life, so incomprehensible
to him, chanting the ancient war-song of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>

his ancestors, and electing to follow them to the Maori
heaven by the stormy path of the reinga.</p>

<p>A chance newspaper&mdash;for, of course, all mail-carrying
had been stopped, as well as their irregular
intelligence department&mdash;brought them the news of
the greater and the lesser world from time to time.
In one of these latter distributors of hopes and fears
they came across these alarming head-lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Gate Pah! Captured after a Stubborn Resistance!
Panic among the 43rd Regiment! Loss of
Officers unprecedented! Names of the Killed and
Wounded!"</p>

<p>The list was long, and eagerly scanned. Many
were names of European reputation; others, again,
of colonial fame, well known to all New Zealand
residents. With their heads close together, the names
were read out first by one, then another, as different
degrees of knowledge or acquaintance prevailed. Mrs.
Summers was repeating the last two or three names,
when she came to Lieutenant Massinger of the Forest
Rangers, "<em>Reported missing!</em>"</p>

<p>"Whom did you say?" cried Hypatia, almost
with a shriek. "Not Roland Massinger? Oh, don't
say he is dead!"</p>

<p>"He is not dead, my dear," said Mrs. Summers,
"only missing. That means, I suppose, that he has
not rejoined his regiment. There is nothing so very
alarming about that."</p>

<p>"Not alarming&mdash;not alarming!" answered Hypatia,
in low anguished tones. "Do you know what it
means? It may be worse than dead&mdash;far worse.
He may be in the hands of the enemy&mdash;given over
to torture. Who can tell? And it is I who am to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>

blame for his presence in this country, for his taking
part in this dreadful war. His blood is upon my
head, wretched girl that I am!"</p>

<p>"My dear Hypatia," said Mrs. Summers, gently
taking her hand, "why rush to such extreme conclusions?
In the first place, the poor fellow is not known
to be dead, or even a prisoner. In the next, you
cannot be held responsible for the rash resolve of a
man whom you felt you could not marry. It is most
unfortunate, I grant you, but surely you are not to
be held accountable."</p>

<p>"No, no! it was all my doing. My heedlessness
and vanity must have encouraged him, or he would
never have thought of me in that way. Then a foolish
ambition stifled any natural liking. I <em>did</em> like and
respect him far more than any other man I had ever
met. And now, this is the end of it! He is dead, and
I am the unhappy cause. I shall never recover it."</p>

<p>Words were of no avail. In vain Cyril Summers
and his wife tried to moderate her passionate remorse.
She could see nothing but the darkest fate and
endless sorrow before her. She had destroyed his
happiness, his career, and now his life had been
sacrificed to her insane desire to travel out of the
sphere which Providence had assigned to her.</p>

<p>Comparatively soothed by Mr. Summers' promise
to send a trusty messenger to procure reliable information
as to his disappearance and probable fate, she at
length consented to retire with her friend and comforter.
To retire, but not to rest. If she slept, troubled
visions of pale corpses and blood-stained victims
mingled with her dreams, and the dawn had appeared
before the slumbers which soothe alike the young

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>

and old, the innocent and the guilty, brought transient
rest and peace to her troubled spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. Summers tranquillized her somewhat by
sending away a native convert, long associated with
the mission, and at her request his wife went also.
They were a trustworthy and devoted pair, whose
loyalty had been well tried since the outbreak of
hostilities. Known by the rebels as Mikonaree natives,
they were enabled to pass and repass unharmed.
Indeed, they were always welcomed by the insurgents,
who never charged them with bad faith. It was
rather the other way, inasmuch as the friendly natives
were more than suspected of giving information of
probable movements by the troops to their countrymen.
But, if it were so, their apologists replied that
it was, after all, merely in accordance with the ancient
Maori custom, which was to send notice to the enemy
that they were coming to attack them. The famous
Hongi did so in the case of his next-door neighbour,
Hinaki, Chief of the Ngatimaru tribe, when they
met in Sydney, at Mr. Marsden's dinner-table, after the
former's return from England, saying, "Get your tribe
ready as soon as you return, for I am going to attack
you when I get back to Te Hauraki." He was as bad
as his word, and with the aid of civilization (muskets
and powder), succeeded in taking the famous Totara
pah, slaughtering a thousand Ngatimaru, then killing
(and eating) a large proportion of his compatriot's
tribe.</p>

<p>Ponui and Awariki did not lose time, but started
away in light marching order for the seat of war,
secretly pleased and excited by the prospect of hearing
all about the bloody engagement and its attendant

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>

horrors, while manifesting a decent show of sorrow for
the pakeha's early fate.</p>

<p>They were several days absent, during the lingering
hours of which Hypatia held herself to be a prey to
the fabled Furies. She was fully impressed with the
idea that an evil fate had befallen the missing soldier,
on account of which the messengers hesitated to
return, awaiting fuller information.</p>

<p>Thus, daily becoming more and more deeply depressed
and remorseful, she pondered upon the mysterious
workings of Providence, disposed to question
its justice in permitting so bitter a blow to be dealt
to her&mdash;to her, who had always acted in undoubting
faith! Upon what trifling events do the great evils
and misfortunes of life appear to depend! Like
the extra allowance of sunshine in the Alpine world,
which sets free the tiny ice stream, which again unlooses
the blind and devastating avalanche, what a
tragedy had her heedless action set in motion! And
the end was not yet. Of what gruesome, bloodcurdling
tidings might not the messengers be the
bearers!</p>

<p>After a night of miserable imaginings, Hypatia
arose to find that the messengers had returned, and
furnished a report of their inquiries to Mr. Summers,
who, condensing it for her information, hastened to
relieve her worst apprehensions.</p>

<p>"Before entering into detail, let me assure you, my
dear Miss Tollemache," he said, "that we have good
grounds for believing that Sir Roland is alive, and,
if not unwounded, most likely in good hands."</p>

<p>"What do they say?" asked she, with tremulous
lips. "Were they able to see any one who knew?

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>

His friends&mdash;Mr. Slyde, I mean. I have heard they
were comrades."</p>

<p>"They joined the Forest Rangers at the same time,
I heard; and there was also the half-caste guide,
Warwick, a very fine fellow, who has attached himself
to our friend. Ponui saw both of them."</p>

<p>"Surely they would know. They did not desert
him?"</p>

<p>"There was no hint of desertion. Every officer
of note was killed or wounded within the first twenty
minutes of the assault of the storming party&mdash;they
among the number. Warwick was severely wounded.
Mr. Slyde was unconscious, and it was thought
mortally wounded; but after Warwick had staggered
to the place where he had seen Lieutenant Massinger
fall, he found that he had disappeared."</p>

<p>"Then they know nothing&mdash;absolutely <em>nothing</em>!"
said Hypatia. "I thought you said there were grounds
for believing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allow me to continue," said the Reverend Cyril.
"Awariki went among the women of the camp, of
whom there were many. There she found a cousin
who had married a Ngapuhi. She seemed to have
been under fire also, as she had a bullet through her
upper arm."</p>

<p>"I <em>should</em> like to have been there," said Hypatia,
her eyes lighting up with a gathering intensity, as
she gazed before her towards the dark-hued mountains
which bounded their landscape. "What did
she see?"</p>

<p>"As she rushed forward through the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>&mdash;for her
husband was badly wounded&mdash;she saw the 'pakeha
rangatira,' as she called him, fall, apparently dead.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>

A Maori was just about to tomahawk him, when
Mr. Mannering (Tao-roa, as they call him) dashed
him aside, knocking him down, and calling aloud to
his people, two of whom lifted up the pakeha, and
commenced to carry him to the rear. Immediately
afterwards several women joined them, one of whom
she was confident was Erena Mannering, his daughter,
who, of course, was well known to the tribe. After
this ensued the extraordinary panic of the 43rd, and
all trace of him was lost."</p>

<p>"Then they did not succeed in getting him back
to the Ngapuhi camp (isn't that the name?), and they
do not know what has become of him, after all?"</p>

<p>"Merely this, that Awariki says she is certain that
if Erena had been taken prisoner, she is a person of
such importance that the whole <i>hapu</i> would have been
sent in pursuit. She is confident that she and the
others are in safety, or else Mr. Mannering would not
be at ease and with his people."</p>

<p>"But why did she not ask him?"</p>

<p>"He is a war chief of the Ngapuhi, and she, a
common person, did not dare to address him on such
a subject. It would not be <i>tika</i>, or etiquette, breaches
of which are severely punished."</p>

<p>"But what do <em>you</em> think yourself? All this is very
slender evidence&mdash;mere hearsay, in fact."</p>

<p>"I fully believe that he is in some secure retreat,
watched over by this extraordinary girl, Erena Mannering,
whose courage and devotion have, under Providence,
saved his life."</p>

<p>"May she find His mercy in her hour of need!"
said Hypatia, with clasped hands and streaming
eyes. "If it be so, my soul will be freed from a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>

burden almost too heavy to bear. It may be hoping
against hope, but I really begin to believe that his
life will be spared. That granted by Heaven, I shall
have nothing&mdash;positively <em>nothing</em>&mdash;to wish for in the
future."</p>

<p>The remaining incidents in the capture of the
memorable Gate Pah were duly recorded by Awariki
for the benefit of the household&mdash;how the sailors, the
sea-warriors of the pakeha, whose raiment was of a
blue colour, they who sprang over the palisades as
if they were ships' rigging, and the men in red who
fought madly and cursed always, had been bewitched
by the spell of the Tohunga of the Ngaiterangi, and
had fled. The men in big hats (the Forest Rangers),
who walked through the bush, the flax, and the
fern by night and day; the Ngapuhi, who rushed on
like a breaking wave, were all in vain against the
rifle-pits of the Ngaiterangi, whereby men were killed
without seeing who fired at them.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Passing from one mood to the other, as is wont
with women whose highly strung nervous system seems
impatient of continuous action, Hypatia at length
made up her mind that Massinger was alive, and safely
bestowed in some sylvan retreat, under the care of
this mysterious, fascinating Maori girl, of whom she
had already heard much.</p>

<p>The natural jealousy, invariably felt by the average
woman during the appropriation by another one of
an erstwhile, probable, or even possible lover, had no
place in Hypatia's generous mind. "If only he is
alive and well, I care nothing," thought she. "That
she risked her life to save his, I can well believe.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>

All honour to her. I am at least guiltless of his
blood. I shall always feel grateful to her, for lifting
that load from my soul."</p>

<p>Thus, when she arose next morning and commenced
to busy herself about the indispensable duties
of the household, she experienced a feeling of relief
to which she had been long a stranger. The day
was fine, the clouds of heaven had disappeared, it
would seem, simultaneously with those of her spirit.
As in the Northern Britain, with its frequent rain
and hail, mist and snow, this rare day, on which the
disturbing forces of the elements held truce, was
inexpressibly lovely. The mountain snow-crown was
revealed in all its purity and austere majesty, a silver
diadem against the blue and lustrous heavens. The
fruit trees in the garden, the oaks and elms, poplars
and walnuts, planted in fond remembrance of the
dear old home-land, seemed bursting into redundant
greenery. The river rippled and murmured under its
o'er-arching ferns, and as the little band of dark-skinned
children, with their glancing eyes and smiling
faces, all obedient and cheerful, passed on to the
modest building, wherein they were daily so patiently
taught by their pastor and his wife, she could hardly
refrain from expressing her thankfulness for the
success of this single-hearted enterprise, in which she
had been deemed worthy to share.</p>

<p>That the wave of barbaric warfare might at any
moment sweep over the peaceful scene, leaving ruin
and desolation in its track, seemed, in the glory of
that beauteous morn, incredible and preposterous.
During later musings, however, when the routine
business of the little school failed to absorb her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>

attention, the thought would obtrude itself of the
strange complication of affairs which would arise if,
as was rumoured, Roland was about to marry this
half-savage girl, as she could not but consider her.
Beautiful she was by all report, devoted she must
have been to her white lover, educated to a certain
extent, and, in virtue of her father's lands granted in
earlier times, an heiress of considerable pretensions.
But&mdash;&mdash;! She well knew what a death-in-life it would
be considered by his English friends. Of course, it
was far from improbable. Younger sons and others
of aristocratic British families had married these
fascinating half-caste girls, even those of pure Maori
blood. This she knew from authentic sources. In
this distant land, so far from British social edicts, such
a marriage was not looked upon as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</i>.
And if such should be his lot, who would have
been the dominant factor in thus shaping his destiny?
Who but herself, unwilling, doubtless, but none the
less the primary agent in his deportation, his colonial
career, with its risks, dangers, and this irrevocable
lapse&mdash;finally, his absorption in a different class
and an alien race? She felt minded to groan aloud.
Why should she have been selected to work all this
misery and ruin, ending, perhaps, in death? Why
could she not foresee the direful consequences flowing
from his fatal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrainement</i>?</p>

<p>It was hard, very hard. Other men had paid her
court before and since his advent. They had accepted
their dismissals calmly, carelessly, irritably, sullenly,
according to their several temperaments; in no case
had serious results followed. They had mended their
damaged or disturbed organs by philosophy, travel

,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>

gaiety, or marriage, chiefly affecting the latter anodyne.
It was surely one of the ironies of Fate that the consequences
to this particular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pretendu</i> had been so
serious&mdash;the only one as to whose denial she had felt
suspicion of her heart's teaching in the ordeal.</p>

<p>Now, at least, all was over. She had decreed that
he should have no further part or lot in her life. If
he was safe, Fate might do her worst. She had always
claimed the right to mould her own existence. Surely
she could do so still. Yet she sighed as she told
herself thus proudly that she was sufficient for her
own high conception of duty. As to happiness, that
was another thing. Who were we, worms of the
dust, ephemera of the hour, that we should arrogate
to ourselves the right to a condition of perfect satisfaction?
Harmony with our surroundings, always
improbable, was chiefly impossible. The stars in
their courses, as well as all the powers of darkness,
were leagued to prevent it. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;Here
the introspective reverie ceased, and Hypatia
recalled herself to the more urgent and practical
demands of daily life.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>On the following morning Mr. Summers appeared
at breakfast in an unwonted state of excitement,
almost of agitation.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my dear Cyril," inquired the
anxious wife. "Is the war news worse than usual?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that," he said, with a reassuring
smile, "but important, notwithstanding. I
have just heard that the bishop is coming to pay us a
visit, and will stay all night on his way to Tauranga."</p>

<p>"How did you hear? You quite frightened me.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>

I shall be charmed to have him. Hypatia will be
overjoyed, I know. He is one of her heroes."</p>

<p>"A Maori messenger gave me this note," he
replied, producing a twisted and discoloured piece of
paper, on which was written&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">My dear Cyril</span>,</p>

<p>"I propose, with God's blessing, to be with
you on Tuesday at midday. If Mrs. Summers can
accommodate me, I should like to remain with you
for one night. Will hold service in afternoon.
Assemble the people&mdash;it may be for the last time.</p>

<p class="p20">
"<span class="smcap">G. A. New Zealand.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"And when does he say that we may expect
him?" asked Hypatia.</p>

<p>"At or before midday," replied Mr. Summers.
"Of course, he will only remain for the night, as he
is anxious to push on to Tauranga. But he would
like to hold an afternoon service; so I must get in all
our people in the neighbourhood, and, of course, the
school-children."</p>

<p>"I am charmed with the idea," said Hypatia.
"Just fancy! I have had him in my thoughts ever
since I thought of coming to New Zealand. One
does not often see an <em>apostle</em> in the flesh. And he
is one, if ever it is given to man to behold one of
God's messengers."</p>

<p>"That I, too, am overjoyed, you will not doubt,"
said Cyril. "I have a filial feeling towards him. I
was one of his curates when he first came to New
Zealand. How many a long journey on foot we
made together! He is a tireless walker, and a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>

champion athlete in half a dozen classes. Such a
man in a boat, too! He has risked his life scores of
times to my knowledge. And now to think that so
much of his life's labour has been lost! It is heartbreaking."</p>

<p>"Do not say that, my dear Cyril," came in Mary
Summers' quiet voice. "The good seed has been
sown. In the time to come it will bring forth, 'some
fiftyfold, some an hundredfold,' as we are told in
God's Word. Look what poor Henare Taratoa did,
even when fighting against us in the Gate Pah!
That was the fruit of our teaching here, I am
thankful to say."</p>

<p>"What was that?" said Hypatia.</p>

<p>"One of the Maori women that came away from
the Gate Pah said that when Colonel Booth was
lying mortally wounded and perishing with thirst&mdash;for
there was no water in the pah for the last two days&mdash;Henare
stole out by night and passed through our
lines, thereby risking his life, and brought back a
calabash of water, which he placed by the side of the
dying man. It was found there next morning by
our men after the natives had left the pah."</p>

<p>"What a splendid fellow!" said Hypatia. "He
fought for his country, as why should he not? But
then, having received the Christian faith, he followed
implicitly the precepts he had learned. Our men
would have given water to wounded Maoris, but
which of them would have risked his life to procure
it?"</p>

<p>"I could tell you of other instances of similar
conduct," said Mr. Summers. "The bishop, when he
comes, will, I am sure, add to my list. But we must

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>

set to work now to ensure him a suitable reception.
You will have a sermon, too, which, like all his
addresses, will be deeply impressive."</p>

<p>All requisite preparations having been made, and
a sort of "fiery cross" sent round in the hands of a
fleet-limbed native youngster, a considerable gathering
of Maoris of all ages and conditions was present at
the appointed time. They came in honour of that
heroic personage, George Augustus Selwyn, the
famous Bishop of New Zealand, the hero of a hundred
legends, the pioneer missionary, the modern embodiment
of faith, zeal, and devotion, who had always
been willing&mdash;nay, passionately eager&mdash;in the words
of St. Paul, "to spend and be spent" in the service of
his Master.</p>

<p>Hypatia stood back a little space while Mr.
Summers and his wife warmly welcomed their pastor
and master, with an earnestness there was no
mistaking. The dark-skinned contingent then closed
in, and obstructed her view of the man whom (with
one exception), of all living personages, she was the
most anxious to see, whom by reputation she honoured
with a feeling akin to adoration.</p>

<p>He had come attended only by a middle-aged
Maori, whose grizzled countenance and war-worn
features showed that he had done his share in the
professional occupation of the Maori <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilhomme</i> of
the period. He stood apart, leaning on his musket,
but from the respect with which he was treated by
all who approached, it was evident that he was a
personage of no ordinary consideration.</p>

<p>It was a scene of more than ordinary interest.
The older members of the <i>hapu</i> who still dwelt in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>

the vicinity of the mission, were chiefly those who
from age or infirmity were debarred from going to
the war, then waged within so short a distance of
their homes. A large proportion was composed of
women, children, and young people not yet entitled
to rank as combatants. All in turn came to be
presented to the <i>Pihopa</i> Rangatira, making obeisance
due and lowly. To each one he addressed a few
words in Maori, the replies to which were made with
evident pleasure, the children almost gasping with
pride and gratification at the honour of the interview.
Inquiries were made after well-known men, who had
formerly been regular attendants at the little church,
but too often resulted in downcast looks, as the sad
word <i>maté</i> (dead) came forth, and in broken accents
the name of the battle, skirmish, or locality was
uttered. Well posted in the personal history of the
missionary centres and their converts, the bishop
never failed to bestow a word of sympathy or
condolence upon the mourners.</p>

<p>The reception being ended, Mr. Summers announced
that the assembly was free to betake itself to their
<i>kai</i> (or meal), which had been prepared, taxing to
the utmost the resources of the establishment.</p>

<p>"Permit me, my lord, to present to you Miss
Tollemache, a friend and schoolfellow of my wife,"
said Mr. Summers, as they moved towards the cottage.
"A young lady lately from England, who has cast
in her lot with us."</p>

<p>The bishop looked with extreme surprise at the
distinguished-looking girl, so unlike what he naturally
expected to see at the place and time. Bowing,
however, with easy grace, he said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot congratulate you upon the
occasion you have selected in which to commence
your labours in the Master's vineyard. Have you had
previous experience, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I have had two years' work in and around
Whitechapel," said she. "I took up the East End
City Mission work soon after I finished my college
course."</p>

<p>"Then you have quitted your first sphere of
usefulness, may I say, for a wider field?"</p>

<p>"I discovered," said Hypatia, "that the locality
was not suited to my age and disposition. I retired
in favour of more experienced workers. Gathering
from the letters of my dear friend and schoolfellow,
Mrs. Summers, that she needed help, I decided to
come here."</p>

<p>"And you did well, my dear young lady, to
follow the dictates of your heart, though I would
it had happened a few years previously, when we
were all rejoicing in the fruition of our hopes and
the visible reward of years of toil and privation.
Now, alas! there have been sad backslidings, griefs,
and discouragements. I have been sorely tempted
to despair; but He who has hitherto led us through
the wilderness will not abandon us now. May His
blessing be upon you, my dear child, and upon all
in this household. Though terrors encompass us, we
know in whom to trust, as our Defender and Guide."</p>

<p>As he spoke, standing within sight of the mountain
and the wave, with head raised, and that noble
countenance illumined with the courage that is not
of this earth&mdash;the fervent faith in things not seen&mdash;he
appeared to Hypatia as a prophet inspired,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>

transfigured, worthy to bear His sacred message, to
speak the words of the Most High. Her overwrought
emotional feelings overpowered her. Yielding to an
irresistible impulse, she cast herself on her knees
before him and cried aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bless me, O my father, even me!"</p>

<p>Strongly stirred, the good bishop laid his hands
solemnly upon her head, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"May the Lord God, Most High, Most Mighty,
bless, protect, and save thee, dear child, from all evils
of body and mind, also from all the sorrows and terrors
of this distracted land. May He shield thee in the
hour of need, and may His guidance be with thee until
thou art led in safety to thy home and thy friends.
For Jesus Christ's sake. Amen."</p>

<p>Hypatia retired to the little room which she
had occupied since her sojourn in Oropi, feeling a
renewed confidence in the vocation which she had
adopted, and a fervent resolve to persevere in the
path marked out for her, no matter what obstacles
might present themselves.</p>

<p>When she appeared at the simple midday meal,
all traces of emotion and excitement had vanished.
The little household talked freely of the conclusion
of the war as being at hand, and, that once an
established fact, the recovery of the country and the
revival of the Church were but matters of time.</p>

<p>"And do you think that the two races will ever
agree to live in peace and amity, after all the blood
that has been shed?" asked Hypatia, leaning forward
with a rapt and eager look upon her face which
reminded the bishop of the early Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>"One may well doubt, Miss Tollemache," said he,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>

with a sad yet unshaken air of confidence. "The
best blood of England has been shed like water in
these sieges and engagements. Still, I foresee the
termination. It cannot be distant now. The flower
of the Maori warriors and their leading chiefs lie low.
All history teaches us that a conquered people is
always absorbed into the superior race in course of
time."</p>

<p>"But the difference in origin and tradition?"
queried Mr. Summers.</p>

<p>"Is by no means an insuperable obstacle," answered
the bishop. "In those mixed unions which have
already taken place, no degeneration of type is
apparent; indeed, to speak frankly, it has even
appeared to me that the offspring in many instances
show an advance, physically and mentally, upon both
the parent stocks. I could name instances, but it is
perhaps unnecessary."</p>

<p>"We have our Joan of Arc, too," interposed Mrs.
Summers; "only, unfortunately for the romance, she
is fighting or nursing, whichever it may be, on the
invaders' side."</p>

<p>"You mean Erena Mannering," said the bishop.
"I know her well&mdash;or did, rather, in the dear old past
days. She is truly a noble damsel in every sense of
the word. Her Herculean father is a paladin for
valour, struggling with the tastes of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> and
philosopher. In a different age he would have stood
at a monarch's right hand, or more probably have
been a conqueror in his own person. Her mother
was a chieftainess, brave, beautiful, and of long
descent. No wonder that she is a marvel of womanhood!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is not without friends who appreciate her,"
said Hypatia, smiling at the enthusiasm of the
sympathetic prelate. "Fortunate girl! to be born
to a heroine's task, a heroine's applause. This is the
last home of romance, it would appear, since it has
quitted Britain, at any rate for the present."</p>

<p>"Have you heard the last rumour about her, my
lord?" said Mr. Summers.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Koihua and I came across the
bush after leaving the Forest Rangers before Orakau.
I trust no harm to her is feared."</p>

<p>"No, but the situation is not wholly free from
risk. A young lieutenant of the Forest Rangers,
wounded in the storming party, which was repulsed
at the Gate Pah, is reported missing. It is said that
she was seen with a small party of natives, who
carried him off at the bidding of her father, and that
neither she nor he have been since heard of."</p>

<p>"In that case it is most probable that she saved
his life, and, in the absence of definite information, I
should be inclined to believe that he has been taken
to a place of safety, where he will remain for the
present. What did you say his name was?"</p>

<p>"Roland Massinger."</p>

<p>"Not De Massinger of the Court, in Herefordshire&mdash;surely
not?" said the bishop, more keenly interested.
"I saw him in camp when I came from Pukerimu,
poor boy! I knew his people well in England&mdash;among
the very oldest families in the land. I met
him soon after his arrival in Auckland. Whatever
hard fate brought him into this disastrous strife?
But I should not say fate; rather the will of God,
which often from present chastening leads to our

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>

eventual gain. But the time draws near for our
service&mdash;the last, most probably, that I shall hold here.
It will be my farewell to these poor people, whom I
have loved and prayed for so often."</p>

<p>And as the good man retired to his chamber for
the preparation of prayer which he always held to be
necessary, even in the most thinly populated and
apparently humble localities, Hypatia took the opportunity
of escaping from a conversation which threatened
embarrassing conditions.</p>

<p>Punctually at the appointed hour, the bell of the
little church having sounded for the canonical time,
the man of God walked through the crowd of dark-skinned
proselytes, who awaited his arrival with
unaffected reverence; and murmurs of approbation
were heard as he paced with solemn steps towards
the humble building, for which many of those present
had contributed labour or materials. Yet were not
all fully agreed. Some of the older men had been
acted upon by the disaffected of the tribe, and hardly
concealed their distrust of the pihopa, who went
between the contending forces, and might, perhaps,
convey information to their foes. This allegation,
openly made at the rebel camp, caused the good
bishop the most poignant grief&mdash;to think that his
people, his children in the Lord, as he fondly called
them, should distrust him, who for them, for their
present advantage and eternal weal, had sacrificed
the intellectual luxuries of the parent land, his place
among the noble and the great, all the unspeakable
social advantages which await the distinguished son
of literature and the Church in Britain! And for
what? To live in self-imposed exile in a distant

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>

colony, among a barbarous people but recently
redeemed from the grossest heathen practices! It
was more than discouraging, it was heartbreaking,
to one of his sensitive temperament and fervent
spirit.</p>

<p>The service of the Church of England was read
by Mr. Summers. Hypatia was touched by the
manner in which the responses were made by young
and old. Nowhere in the world could more earnestness
have been shown, less apparent wavering from
the appointed ritual, which was wholly in the Maori
tongue. She had made sufficient progress in the
language to follow easily&mdash;a task lightened by the
preponderance of vowels and the disuse of the perplexing
consonants so frequent in European tongues.
A greater advance can be made in Maori in a shorter
time than in almost any living language. There is
much of the <i>ore rotundo</i> claimed for the noble
fundamental languages, which now only survive
among degenerate descendants of the orators, warriors,
statesmen, and artists, who, while they rolled out the
sonorous sentences, swayed the known world with
their pre-eminence in arts and arms, speech and
song.</p>

<p>The prayers of the Anglican Church were concluded.
Then the great apostle of the South Seas ascended
an ornate pulpit, the gift of a few English friends
of Mr. Summers, the carving of which had much
impressed the native congregation, themselves by
no means without practice in this ancient section of
art. In his sermon&mdash;short, fervent, and chiefly persuasive&mdash;he
appealed to those better feelings which
the teaching of the missionary clergy, of whatever

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>

denomination, had been chiefly desirous of fostering.
"What," he asked, "had been the condition of the
tribes before that great and good man Marsden, the
pioneer pastor, came among them? War unbridled,
ruthless, remorseless, with its accompaniments still
more dreadful&mdash;slavery, torture, child-murder, the
eating of human flesh, practices which, to their
honour be it spoken, the Maoris as a nation had
discontinued. Were they not ashamed of these
things?" ("Yes, yes!" from the assembled crowd.)
"Who had taught them to be ashamed of these
things? The missionary clergy, the pakeha from
beyond the seas. Who had given them the seed,
the grain, the potato, the domestic animals, the
tools of iron, from which they now reaped such
abundant harvests and stores of produce? Bread,
flour-mills, garden-seeds and vegetables,&mdash;all these
came from the pakeha. Who taught them the use of
all these things? The Mikonaree. He laboured with
his hands, he lived poorly, he coveted nothing for
himself, he only held a small portion of their waste
lands on which to grow food for himself and his
family.</p>

<p>"He had done all this. But he had done more.
He had taught them to worship the only true God,
and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord&mdash;the God of
mercy, of truth, of charity, of peace. And had they
not lived in peace, in plenty, in good will among
themselves, until this war arose, which was now
raging to the destruction of Maori and pakeha alike?
Who counselled this shedding of blood, this burning
of pahs? The clergy? No. They knew that the
voice of every clergyman, every missionary in both

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>

islands, had been against it, was against it now. If
his advice had been taken, a runanga would have
been held, of the wisest pakehas and the high
rangatiras. Judges like Mannering and Waterton
would have sat there&mdash;men who knew the Maori
tongue and the Maori customs. They would have
done justice. The Waitara would never have been
bought from Teira. The Maori law would have
been respected, as well as the English law, in which
every man has equal rights, the native as well as
the pakeha. Then there would have been no war;
no killing of pakeha settlers who wished to cultivate
the soil and to live in peace; no death of the
soldiers and sailors; no death of the volunteers who
wished to buy and sell in the towns, who bought
the natives' pigs and potatoes, their wheat and their
flax; no death of high chiefs or of the young men
of the tribes, of officers of the troops, of officers of
the ships. All these of the young and the old who
now lie cold in the earth or beneath the sky would
be alive and well this day." Here more than one
face betrayed deep feeling; falling tears and gestures
of unutterable anguish told their tale.</p>

<p>"But the war, unhappily, had commenced, and still
raged. Unwise white men, proud and haughty chiefs,
had been impatient, and forced on the war. Had the
Maoris respected the lessons they had been taught,
and been patient, even when suffering injustice, all
would have been well. The Waitara block would
have been given up. It has been given up <em>now</em>.
They had many friends in the pakeha runanga;
even in Sydney the Kawana Dennitoni had sent
a letter in their favour, warning the council of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>

pakehas not to take Waitara. But there were unwise
men on both sides. Blood was shed. And the state
of war took place. And now you will say, 'This is
all very well, but we knew much of this before.
The state of war is accomplished. What are we to
do? What is best for the Maori people?'</p>

<p>"I will tell you. This is my saying. I have
prayed to God that it may be right and wise, according
to His will, and for your benefit, who are my
children in the Lord. We have always taught you
to desire peace&mdash;peace and good will towards all
men. Cherish no more hard feelings against the
pakeha. You will have to live in the land with him.
His race is the stronger, the more numerous; he has
ships, soldiers, and guns, more than you can number;
they are like the sands of the seashore.</p>

<p>"The war must soon be over. I, who speak to you
now, say so. Heed not those foolish men of your
race who tell you to go on fighting. It is of no use.
When the last battle is fought, and my words come
true, yield yourself to the Kawana, Hori Grey, saying,
'We are conquered. Show us mercy. We desire peace
for the future.' He has always been a friend of the
Maori people. He is a friend now. You will find
that you will receive mercy, that a portion of your
lands will be restored to you. Not all. Part will be
taken for <i>utu</i>, as by Maori custom. After that I
say, heed my words and those of the good Mikonaree
who have always tried to do you good&mdash;who will do
you more good in the future. 'Love your enemies;
do good to those who despitefully use you. If thine
enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink,'
as did Henare Taratoa, whom I taught when he was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>

young. You can read your Bible, many of you. Do
what you are there commanded, and it will be well
with you.</p>

<p>"And now it may be that you will see my face no
more. I have been called back to the land whence
I came, so many years ago, to do you good, to help,
to teach every man, woman, and child in this land of
Maui; such I may have done, though the seed of the
Word has sometimes perished by the wayside. But
other seed, I will believe, has taken root, and will
bring forth, in due time, some twenty, some fifty, some
an hundred fold.</p>

<p>"And when the day comes, as come it will, when
peace overspreads the land, when the churches are
again crowded, when the schools are full of your
children, when the harvests are bounteous, and the
Maori people are as well clothed, as well fed, and as
well taught as the pakehas, you will hear that your
pihopa, the man who loved you and prayed with you,
is no more. In that hour remember that I told you
all this would come to pass, and honour his <i>mana</i>
by obeying the words of his mouth, and the commandment
of the most high God."</p>

<p>As the sermon neared this conclusion, the hearts
of the people were more deeply and strongly affected.
Tears streamed down the faces of the younger members
of the congregation. Sobs and groans were frequent.
And as he turned to leave the little chapel, a simultaneous
rush was made to the door, so as to be enabled
to say a last farewell. All doubt and hesitation as
to his actions since the war were swept away by the
magic of his vibrating voice, the magnetic force of his
earnest tones. They now commenced to realize that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>

they were losing a friend in need, a judge in Israel, a
champion in the day of their oppression.</p>

<p>As he left the church with his host and hostess,
the women and children clustered around him, with
cries of grief and genuine sorrow. They knelt before
him, they struggled for the right to kiss his hand,
they implored him to come again; they vowed that
they would always be his children, and would obey
his commands till their death.</p>

<p>It was to Hypatia a scene indescribably affecting.
The tears came to her own eyes as she stood there,
sympathetic, emotional, wondering no more at the
contagious power of the united forces of faith, enthusiasm,
and oratory combined to sway a multitude and
lead a people to heroic deeds. The men stood aloof
while the women were making their moan, and then
came forward respectfully, each to receive a handshake
and a word of greeting, advice, or friendly warning.
Last of all, the few elders who had attended as it
were under protest, made known their recantation of
doubt or distrust. An aged chief, whose scarred
countenance and limbs told a tale of ancient wars,
hobbled forward, leaning upon his <i>hano</i>. With an
air of mingled dignity and despondency he thus
delivered himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is my saying, the saying of Tupa-roa the
aged. I have listened to the words of the pihopa
rangatira; they are good words. The great Atua
of the pakehas has spoken in them. If we had
hearkened to them before, if we had said at Waitara,
'This thing is unjust, but we will not fight; we will
leave it to a Court; we will send a letter to the
Kawini across the sea; we will ask for justice till the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>

winds cease to blow, till the fire-mountain in White
Island stops breathing flame;' then our wisdom
would have been great. What the pakeha says
is true. We had many friends, just men, in the
pakeha runanga. After all, Waitara was given back.
Why? Were the pakehas afraid? No! See what
has come of it. My son is dead, and his"&mdash;pointing
to another elder who stood near him&mdash;"and Takerei
and Puoho, all dead&mdash;all gone past the reinga, where
I also shall soon follow. But we were as children, who
see not into the future. Those unwise ones, who
should be silent in council, were allowed to lead the
nation; and now we are a broken people, our pahs
are burned with fire. Our lands are taken, our sons
are dead, also our high chiefs. If we had listened
to the pihopa, to the Mikonaree, to Kawana, Hori
Grey, these things would not have come to pass.
My saying to you, O people, is to show honour
to the pihopa and his <i>mana</i>, and so will it be
well with you, with all of us, and our children's
children."</p>

<p>Here he advanced, and motioning to one of the
seniors who carried his greenstone <i>mere</i>, an emblem
always of honour and authority, he made a gesture
of humility and handed it to the bishop, who, receiving
it, shook hands warmly with the old warrior and his
aged companions. At this moment Mr. Summers
gave out the Hundredth Psalm, which the whole congregation
took up and sang with wonderful fervour
and correctness, many of the voices being rich and
expressive. At the close, the bishop, raising his
hand, solemnly pronounced the benediction, and the
congregation slowly departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a wonderful scene!" said Hypatia to Mrs.
Summers, as she and the two children walked slowly
after the bishop and her husband. "I feel certain
that they will not believe it in England, when I write
and tell them what interest these people showed in
the service. There was none of the yawning or
irreverence that one often sees in a village church
there. How they hung upon the bishop's words! I
could understand a good deal, but not all. It is a
fine language, too, and by no means difficult to
learn."</p>

<p>"Didn't old Tupa-roa talk well, mother?" said the
eldest girl, a fair-haired Saxon-looking child, the rose
bloom of whose cheeks did justice to the temperate
climate. "He looked very fierce, too, when he spoke
about the war, his sons, and the chiefs, all <em>maté, maté,
maté.</em>"</p>

<p>"I thought it inexpressibly mournful," said Hypatia.
"The aged veteran, a war-chief, I suppose, in his time,
grieving over his broken tribe and ruined land. Owning,
too, that if wise councils had prevailed all might
have been avoided."</p>

<p>"He was a great chief once," said the little girl.
"Old Tapaia told me that he used to kill people, and
eat them too. Wasn't that horrid? But he has been
good for a long time, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't believe all that Tapaia tells you,"
said Mrs. Summers; "and you know I don't like you
to talk to the old women, only to Hiraka, who is sure
to tell you nothing foolish. You monkeys can chatter
Maori as well as any child in the kainga. I think I
must forbid you going there at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I will be good, and never talk to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>

the old women, if you will let me go sometimes. The
children are so funny, and they play such nice games.
One is just like our cat's cradle."</p>

<p>"You can go, my dear child, when I am with you,
or Miss Tollemache, but not by yourself. And now
it must be nearly tea-time, so let us get home. The
bishop will leave us at sunrise, I know."</p>

<p>That evening, with its homely meal, was long
remembered by Hypatia. The quiet converse continued
far into the night with Mr. and Mrs. Summers.
Even, moreover, a short private conversation which
the good bishop found time to arrange with her sank
deeply into her heart.</p>

<p>Having questioned her kindly but closely as to
her motives for leaving her friends, and taking up
the hard, unlovely, possibly dangerous, vocation she
had adopted, he warned her against mistaking a
transient preference&mdash;the novelty of a mission to the
heathen&mdash;for the Divine summons.</p>

<p>"I do you full justice, my dear child," said he;
"you are devoting yourself to the noblest earthly
duty, but I feel it right to warn you that, though the
war must be nearing its close, there may be even
greater dangers in store for isolated households such
as this. Even after the collapse of the hostile tribes,
there may be desperate bands roaming the country,
seeking by plunder and outrage to avenge the downfall
of their race. I have warned Cyril, and have
counselled him, on the first rumour of such horrors, to
remove his household to Auckland, and, even as I
would do in the case of my own daughter, I have
urged him to send you to the protection of any friends
you may have in New Zealand 'until this tyranny be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>

overpast.' Weigh my words well, and may God give
you power to choose aright."</p>

<p>"I cannot fully express my deep gratitude, my
lord, for the honour you have done me, and the
interest you have taken in my welfare. That I did
not devote myself to mission work without earnest
and prayerful thought, your lordship may rest assured.
I counted the cost beforehand, and now I cannot
dream of deserting my colours, so to speak. You
will not think that I am quite destitute of prudence.
I shall accept the decision of my dear friend and her
husband. If they think it imperative to retreat in
the face of too evident danger, I shall accompany
them. But as long as they remain, whatever may
be the disquieting rumours, I shall be found at their
side. '<em>Ake, ake, ake</em>,' as the men at Orakau said. We
must not let the Maoris have all the glory on their
side."</p>

<p>The bishop smiled as she used the historical words
of the unconquered garrison, but could not forbear
gazing with admiration at the high-souled maiden, as
she stood with upraised head and flashing eyes before
him; a marvel of classic beauty, embodying all the
nobility of form and feature which painters and
sculptors have from the earliest ages loved to depict&mdash;an
emblem of matchless womanhood devoted to a
lofty ideal.</p>

<p>"We are all in God's hands," he said softly. "Let
Him do what seemeth to Him good. May He bless
and protect you, my child, and all who are of this
household to-night."</p>

<p>Stars were contending with the rain-clouds of a
stormy dawn as Hypatia drew back the curtain from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>

the window of her bedroom and looked out. She saw
the bishop come forth from the guest-room at the end
of the verandah, wrapped in his cloak. He handed
his valise to the Maori attendant, Koihua, who stood
motionless at the foot of an English elm tree, and
with staff in hand set forth on the Tauranga road
with the free step and elastic stride of a trained
pedestrian. Once, and once only, at the first turn in
the winding path did he look back for an instant, and,
noting Hypatia's face at the window, waved his hat
in token of farewell, and disappeared in the woodland.
There were tears in Hypatia's eyes, springing from a
sentiment she could hardly analyze, as she turned
from the casement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orakau</span> was abandoned. The Gate Pah had been
lost and won. It had also been avenged at Te Ranga,
where a hundred and twenty Ngaiterangi warriors lay
dead in the trenches, and the 43rd had full <i>utu</i> for
the slaughter of their officers and comrades. With
few exceptions, all the high chiefs were among the
slain. The boastful Rawiri, the chivalrous Te Oriori,
the Christian convert Henare Taratoa, had fought
their last fight. On the body of the latter was found
a letter in the native language, and the text, "If thine
enemy hunger, give him food; if he thirst, give him
water."</p>

<p>Orakau was the Flodden of the Maori nation.
As the fugitives from the blood-stained pah trooped
across the fords of the Puniu on the night succeeding
the fight, the parallel may well have occurred to Sir
Walter Scott's countrymen, so many of whom have
adopted New Zealand as their home.</p>

Ranga. The turbulent Waikato tribes had lost their
high chiefs, their bravest young men. The flower of
the land of Maui lay low. The universal wail rose
high in a hundred kaingas. Taught by bitter experience,
the more intelligent natives had arrived at the
conclusion that the resistless pakeha must be obeyed.
His soldiers and his sailors, his volunteers and his
allies (leading tribes of their own blood), his guns and
his mortars, were all too powerful. Their chiefs who
had visited England and seen the might of Britain
had told them as much before. But, strong in the
pride of their own power and the oracles of the
Tohungas, they did not believe it. Now it was too
plain to be disputed. Defeat was written in the
burned and disabled pahs, in the ruined farms, in the
confiscated lands of their ancestors, which they had
no power to redeem. This, however, was in strict
accordance with Maori usage, with the law and custom
of Rauparaha, of Hongi Ika, of Te Waharoa, those
ruthless conquerors and their ancestors who had
ravaged and annexed the lands of tribal foes from
time immemorial. <i>Væ Victis</i> was one of the oldest
of human laws. It was theirs also. One grim feature
of a returning and successful expedition, the train of
downcast or weeping slaves, driven along with blows
and shouts of derision, was wanting in this campaign.
No heads of chiefs or warriors were tossed out or
stuck on poles as village after village was passed. No
bound captive was handed over to the relations of the
fallen for slow and dreadful torture. On the contrary,
all the combatants, save those convicted of murder or
outrage, were dismissed to their homes, while their
wounded were tended in the hospitals of these

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>

strangely constituted pakehas with the same care and
skilfulness as their own.</p>

<p>At Te Ranga was the last stand made by the
Maori for the possession of the lands of his forefathers.
No more might he roam whither he would
by river and mountain, by lake, shore, or forest stream.
The white man's axe rang ceaselessly in his ancient
woodlands; the white man's fields, his crops and fences,
raised barriers to free untrammelled wanderings from
sea to sea. Only in allotted districts, marked out by
the white surveyor, would he be permitted to live out
his life. Even there, the white man's school, the white
man's church, the white man's policeman, would be
always with him. In the place of the chief who
administered justice and delivered sentence without
remonstrance, without appeal, there sat the white
man's magistrate, hearing evidence which he did not
always understand, fining and imprisoning for offences
against laws of which they had neither experience
nor comprehension.</p>

<p>This was the state of matters to which the Maori
nation had come in the opinion of the older men of
the tribes, and not a few of the younger warriors who
had never quite given in their adhesion to the rule
of the stranger. Haughty and tameless as a race,
showing by a thousand instances their preference for
death before dishonour, such was their state of feeling
at this time, that had there been any other land
available, they would probably have trooped away in
one great migration like the Moors out of Spain,
there to learn to forget their hopes and fears, their
triumphs and their despair, far from the snow-crowned
ranges, the rushing rivers, the fertile valleys,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>

and fire-breathing mountains of their own loved
land.</p>

<p>On the whole, perhaps, it was as well for them,
and by no means to the injury of the usurping pakeha,
that the ever-girdling sea forbade a national exodus.
Stern foe as the Briton has ever been while the fighting
lasts, he is the most just and merciful of the
world's conquerors. Of the great Roman, when the
sandals of his legions trod over the prostrate peoples
of the inhabited earth, it is recorded that he permitted
them such personal and civic liberty as they had
rarely enjoyed under their own rulers. Still, the
privilege and boast of uttering the magical words,
<i>Civis Romanus sum</i>, had to be paid for largely, as in
the Apostle Paul's case. More liberal still, the Briton
presents his beaten foe with the priceless gift of his
equal laws, his equal suffrage. The ægis is thenceforth
held over him, as of a blood-brother and a peer,
a citizen of that world-wide empire scarce arrested by
the poles, which rules and guards by its laws so large
a proportion of the inhabitants of our planet.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>While the high contracting parties were settling
important points to be observed in the treaty, now
necessary after the unconditional surrender made in
person by, and signed by, Wirimu Tamehana Te
Waharoa, the interests of private persons had their
opportunity of consideration. In the ranks of the
Forest Rangers doubts were still expressed respecting
the fate of one Roland Massinger, reported missing
since the affair of the Gate Pah.</p>

<p>Slyde and Warwick were lying in hospital, severely
wounded, still too weak to undertake personal search.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>

Warwick, who was near him when he fell, had
information to give which, if it accounted for his
wounds, was calculated to inspire doubts concerning
his safety.</p>

<p>"He was shot from behind," he said. "I am as
certain of it as that I lie here; it was the act of that
skulking scoundrel Ngarara. I was near him at the
time. Von Tempsky himself was hardly a foot in
front of him as he was trying to spring on to the
parapet, when I heard a shot behind us on the right
flank. Mind, the troops were standing forward for a
bayonet charge, and the covering volleys were on the
left flank. It surprised me, so that I looked round;
there I saw a band of the Ngapuhi that had dashed
up in advance of the main body. Sheltering himself
behind a tree, I saw Ngarara. He had missed the
first time, but had reloaded. I caught sight of his
face for a moment as the second report came, and
Mr. Massinger fell forward on his face. Before I
could turn towards him I was knocked over by a
bullet from a rifle-pit, and knew no more. But a
ranger who was close to me at the time, and helped
to carry me to the rear, heard Mannering shout out
an order, upon which several of the Maketu men closed
round Massinger and carried him off. Following
them up, he was sure that he saw two women. These
he didn't recognize."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if one of them was the girl
he was philandering with at the Terraces. Heard she
was with her father's <i>hapu</i>. Princess and wounded
knight business. Turn up all safe by-and-by."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," mused Warwick. "He's a
treacherous dog, that Ngarara. He'll have another

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>

try before he gives in&mdash;unless the chief shoots him,
which he's very likely to do, on sight."</p>

<p>"Summary justice," said Mr. Slyde. "Points in
savage life, after all. Come to think."</p>

<p>"I <em>saw</em> him do it once," said Warwick. "I was
a boy then. He shot a Maori dead who had helped
to murder a white man before the fellow's friends."</p>

<p>"What did the tribe say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;though there were many of the man's
relations present. They knew he was in the wrong.
Besides, the act was that of a <em>chief</em>. That means a
good deal in this country."</p>

<p>"Seems it does. Power in the land. Must look up
one with an eligible daughter. A hundred thousand
acres of the Waikato land would be a snug dowry.
Live like a baron of the Middle Ages. No more
beastly reports to write. Tell my directors to go to
the reinga."</p>

<p>"How long is it before the doctor says we shall
be fit to travel?" said Warwick, wandering from the
point.</p>

<p>"Three weeks at farthest. I vote we go on the
scout for Massinger. Can't leave him in the tents of
the whatsynames&mdash;Amorites or something. Dance at
his wedding if we can do nothing else."</p>

<p>"I'll see it out," said Warwick.</p>

<p>"So we will, dear boy," said Mr. Slyde. "Have
Ngarara's scalp. Revival of ancient customs. Must
have rational amusement now the war's over."</p>

<p>What did really happen to Massinger was this.
He felt himself struck under the right shoulder from
behind by a hard blow as from a stone, such being
the sensation of a bullet-wound from undoubted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>

personal evidence. Before he had turned round to
see who had given him such a hurt, he felt a queer
faintness, and noticed a stream of blood running
down his breast, while the evil face of Ngarara, lit
up with revengeful triumph, glared at him, partly
covered by a huge kawaka tree.</p>

<p>Before he could combine the concrete and the
abstract sufficiently to formulate a theory, "darkness
covered his eyes," and a sudden death rehearsal was
in full operation.</p>

<p>When he recovered his senses, the night was so
far advanced that he glanced upward to the stars
with a half-conscious, wondering doubt as to his
condition and circumstances. On a rude litter, formed
of branches and twisted flax, the bed of grass and
fern-leaves beneath him being by no means uncomfortable,
he was moving slowly along a forest path,
on which four bearers were trying to carry him as
smoothly as circumstances would admit of. Two
women in native dress walked in front, in one of
whom, as she stopped to speak a word to the bearers,
he had no difficulty in recognizing Erena.</p>

<p>After an answering sentence from the bearer
nearest him, she held up her hand, and the little
party halted. Coming close to his head, which he
was as yet unable to raise, she looked anxiously in
his face, and in softest accents said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have awakened."</p>

<p>The loss of blood had been great, but by some
styptic known to the natives, a people much acquainted
with wounds of all degree of severity, it had been
arrested. He tried to speak; a faint inarticulate
murmur was all the reply he could furnish. He raised

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>

himself; but the effort was too painful, and again he
became unconscious.</p>

<p>When he awoke once more he was aware that
locomotion had ceased, and that he was lying upon
a couch covered with mats. All was darkness, with
the exception of flickering gleams thrown from a fire
which was lighted at the entrance of the vault or
cave in which he was lodged. Becoming more used
to the dim uncertain light, he discerned the limestone
walls and roof, which were festooned with stalactites
in all sorts of fantastic, delicate shapes. There was
a sound as of falling water, so that the difficulty of
assuaging thirst would not be among the privations
suffered by the inmates of this singular retreat. After
a while he was relieved by the appearance of his good
angel, as he felt impelled to call her.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "how has all this come to pass?
I am anxious to hear about the fall of the Gate Pah,
and the way I have been removed to this place."</p>

<p>"I knew," she said, bending over him with the
frank tenderness of a woman who loves passionately,
and does not fear to disguise the fact, "that if you
remained longer where you fell you would stand a
chance of being tomahawked, if not worse treated.
My father gave the order for you to be carried off,
and at the same time signed to me that I and my
cousin Riria were to accompany you. The cave in
which you find yourself is only known to our hapu,
and has always been regarded as being impenetrable
to any one not acquainted with the secret approach."</p>

<p>"But it was evident to me," said he, "that I was
shot through the body. How was the flow of blood
stopped, and the wound found not to be dangerous?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were told," she said, "that it was not mortal
by a well-known tohunga of our tribe, who has been
left a stage behind. He will be here tomorrow, and
is a medicine-man of some repute, I can assure you.
He applied a styptic, which was successful, and found
that the bullet-wound, though it had grazed the lung,
would not be dangerous, though hard to heal."</p>

<p>"I owe everything to you, dearest Erena," he
said, pressing the hand which lay nearest to him;
"and the life you have saved is yours for ever. If I
come scatheless out of this war, you will have no
reason to doubt my gratitude. How shall I ever
repay you?"</p>

<p>"It is only too easy to do so," she said, as she
gazed at him with eyes that glowed with all the
intensity of a woman's love, for the first time awakened
in that passionate nature. "But you must not talk
of gratitude," she continued, with a smile, "or I
shall begin to doubt whether you love me as <em>we</em> love&mdash;in
life, in death, to the grave, and beyond it."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she wound her arms tenderly around
him, and, kissing him upon the forehead, hastily left
the cave.</p>

<p>When she reappeared, bringing such food as the
natives had been able to secure, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now you must eat all you can, and grow strong,
as the sooner we leave this 'Lizard's Cave,' as it is
called, and get back to my father, the better. I know
that he will make for Rotorua as soon as the fighting
is over."</p>

<p>"Tell me about the Gate Pah," he said. "Our
men were falling fast, were they not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes. Nearly all the officers were killed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>

or mortally wounded in less than a quarter of an
hour. Colonel Booth died next day; the captains of
the 43rd were all killed, besides naval and volunteer
officers. The natives had determined to retreat by
the rear of the pah, but suddenly found themselves
met by a detachment of the 43rd. They rushed back,
and, mingling with the soldiers, were taken by them for
a Maori reinforcement. Some one called out "Retreat!"
and the troops, having no officers, were seized with a
panic, made a runaway&mdash;what you call a rout of it."</p>

<p>Massinger groaned. "Who could have imagined
it! Such a regiment as the 43rd! Think what
they did in the Peninsular war! Such things will
happen from time to time. Why didn't they <em>starve</em>
them out?"</p>

<p>"That was what my father and Waka Nene said.
They were surrounded. They had no water, and only
raw potatoes to eat. In a few days they must have
given in. In Heke's war Colonel Despard made just
the same mistake. My father and Mr. Waterton were
there."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Well, of course it was long, long ago&mdash;in 1845;
but I heard my father tell it once, and never forgot
it. You heard of the Ohaieawa Pah, and how the
troops were repulsed then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I read some account of it."</p>

<p>"It was like this fight. The pah was strongly
defended, and the colonel said he would take it by
assault. My father and Mr. Waterton were fighting
along with the Ngapuhi under the chief Waka Nene.
They came to the colonel, and my father said,
'Colonel Despard, if you are going to try to take the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>

pah by assault before you make a breach&mdash;and you
have no artillery heavy enough&mdash;I consider it amounts
to the murder of your men, and it is my duty to tell
you so. The chief Waka Nene is of the same opinion.'</p>

<p>"'What does he know of the science of war?' said
the colonel, angrily.</p>

<p>"'More than you do&mdash;that is, of Maori war,' said
my father.</p>

<p>"'How dare you talk to me like that?' said the
colonel, now very angry. 'I have a great mind to
have you arrested.'</p>

<p>"'What does the pakeha rangatira say?' inquired
Nene of Mr. Waterton, as he saw that something
serious was likely to happen.</p>

<p>"'He says he will arrest us,' said Mr. Waterton.</p>

<p>"Upon this the chief walked forward, and, looking
in the colonel's face, placed an arm on either of their
shoulders. Then he said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'These are <em>my</em> pakehas. You must not touch
them;' and he looked round to his tribe, drawn up
rank by rank at the foot of the hill."</p>

<p>"Well, and what happened?"</p>

<p>"The colonel turned away and said no more.
The Ngapuhi tribe were loyal to the English, and
have been ever since. They would never have conquered
Heke without them."</p>

<p>"So he did attack the pah?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;by bad fortune. The old chief drew his
men off, and would not join in the assault. The
soldiers and sailors, also the volunteers, tried to storm
the pah, but were beaten back with dreadful loss.
Many were killed, and some taken prisoners. The
natives left the pah the next night, but it was a boast

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>

of Heke's tribe for years after that they had beaten
back a pakeha regiment of renown, and that some
day, if all the tribes would unite, they would drive
the whites into the sea."</p>

<p>"It was well for us that they did not unite, by all
accounts," said Massinger; "for their numbers were
greater than ours then by many thousands. Now it
is the other way, and unless they make peace their
doom is sealed."</p>

<p>"You must not talk any more," said Erena, with
playful authority. "Old Tiro-hanga will come up tomorrow,
and then he will say if you can be moved.
You had better try and go to sleep."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The war was now virtually over. The Waikato
tribes and their allies, the Ngatiawa and the Ngatihaua,
had surrendered unconditionally. The wounded
warriors, Slyde and Warwick, were in a condition to
be moved to Auckland, where rest and comfort awaited
them. The military surgeon, in releasing them from
camp quarters and fare, advised them to take advantage
of all the comforts of civilization, which he believed
would effect a more speedy cure than any of the
resources of his profession.</p>

<p>"You've had a narrow shave, both of you," he
said&mdash;"particularly Warwick. When I saw him first,
I hardly thought he was worth carrying to the rear.
We were short of bearers, too; not like those infernal
natives who have so many women about, full of pluck,
and handier than the men for that matter. By-the-by,
what's become of that young friend of yours? It's
rumoured that the Ngapuhi carried him off. Beautiful
daughter, and so on. Romantic&mdash;very."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>"Odd thing. Don't know where he is," said Mr.
Slyde. "Warwick here means to go on the scout as soon
as his blessed wound heals. We're getting anxious."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Warwick. "Depend on it, if
Erena Mannering has him in charge, no harm will
come to him. Not a man of the Ngapuhi but would
die in his defence, always excepting that brute
Ngarara. We don't know who were killed at Orakau
and who got away yet. As long as he's above ground
neither Massinger nor Erena are safe."</p>

<p>"Seems badly managed, don't it," yawned Mr.
Slyde, "when so many a good fellow has gone down,
that reptile should escape? Hope for the best, however.
Feel inclined to help Providence the next time
we meet. Awful sleepy work this recovery business.
I must turn in."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Some anxiety might have been spared to his
friends if they could have beheld Mr. Massinger at
the moment of their solicitude. The sun was declining;
the shimmering plain of Rotorua lake lay calm
and still, save for a lazy ripple on the beach below
the room wherein the wounded man lay, on a couch
covered with mats of the finest texture. Beside him
sat Erena, regarding him from time to time with that
rapt and earnest gaze which a woman only bestows
on the man she loves or the child of her bosom. He
had rallied since the first days of his wound, but the
pallor of his countenance, and his evident weakness,
told those of experience in gunshot wounds that the
progress of recovery had been arrested. In such a
case the danger is worse, say the authorities, than in
the first loss of blood and organic injury. The patient

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>

moved as if to raise himself, but desisted, as if such
effort were beyond him.</p>

<p>"I cannot think," he said, "why I do not gain
strength. I do not seem to have improved in the
least; rather the other way. I wonder if there is
any injury we don't know of."</p>

<p>"Pray God there is not!" she said, bending over
him, and bathing his forehead. "My father says he
never knew old Tiro-hanga's medical knowledge to
fail. He says you only want time to be as well as
ever. How many wounds has he not recovered from?"</p>

<p>"I should be more than willing to believe him,"
said the sick man. "But why am I so wretchedly
weak? I feel as if I would like to die and be done
with it, if I am to lie here for weeks and months.
But I am a beast to complain, after all your goodness,
child," he went on to say, as the girl's eyes filled with
tears. "Please forgive me; I am weak in mind as
well as body."</p>

<p>"Is my love nothing to you?" she cried, with
sudden passion. "My life, my life&mdash;for it hangs on
yours? If you die, I die also. I swear I will follow
you to the reinga, as my mother would have said. I
will not remain behind. Do not doubt of that."</p>

<p>As she spoke she moved nearer to his couch, and,
throwing herself on her knees at his side, took his
hand in both of hers, and, bowing her face upon his
breast, burst into a tempest of sobs, which shook
every portion of her frame.</p>

<p>Massinger, touched and partly alarmed by her grief,
tried by all the means in his power to soothe her,
smoothing her abundant hair the while, as it flowed
over him in a cascade of rippling wavelets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"My darling, my darling!" he said, "I owe my
life to you, and it shall be spent in proving my love
and devotion. You must not despair, you who are
so brave. I am afraid you are not an Ariki, after
all, but only a woman&mdash;the best, the bravest, the
dearest, in the world. This is only a passing faintness.
We shall live to spend many a glad year
together."</p>

<p>"It is I who am weak," she said, lifting her tear-stained
face, and essaying to smile as she drew back the
long silken tresses from her brow. "Something seemed
at that moment to warn me that I should never live
to claim your love. I have often felt it. But, if <em>your</em>
life is spared for long years to come, I shall not mourn.
No, no! But you will never forget your poor Erena,
who loved you&mdash;loved, yes, you will never know how
much!"</p>

<p>As she spoke her last words, she rose to her feet,
pressed one lingering, passionate kiss upon his forehead,
and was gone.</p>

<p>With the dawn the tohunga arrived. This
important and mysterious personage, of which one
was always to be found in the larger sections of a
tribe, combined the offices of priest and sorcerer with
the more practical profession of the physician. Unquestionably,
his knowledge of simples and general
surgery was far from despicable. By incantations
and spells, it was thought in the tribe that he had
foreknowledge of the death or otherwise of his patients.
As a soothsayer he had now used the powerful spell
of the "withered twigs." Chanting a <i>karakia</i>, with a
sudden jerk he broke off from the tree two of equal
size and length. The piece he held in his left hand

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>

snapped off short. The longer twig remained in his
right.</p>

<p>"The pakeha will not die," he exclaimed. "My
art has saved him. It will be good for the Ngapuhi
tribe, and for the maiden Erena, whose mother I so
much loved."</p>

<p>Arriving at the couch of the stricken pakeha, he
looked upon him with solemn and mysterious regard.
He felt his pulse, and minutely scrutinized the cicatrice
of the newly healed wound. Meanwhile the eyes of
the girl, dilated with terror and anxiety, watched his
inscrutable countenance, as the mother of the sick
child in more conventional abodes fixes her gaze on
the physician, whose words contain the issues of life
or death.</p>

<p>"Speak, O Tiro-hanga! Say whether he will die&mdash;and
I also. One word will serve for both."</p>

<p>The tohunga placed his hand upon the shoulder
of the excited girl, whose every nerve seemed quivering,
as if the tension of mind and body had exhausted
the limit of human endurance.</p>

<p>"As you are, so was your mother in her youth," he
said, speaking with deep though restrained feeling
in the Maori tongue; "in those days when the tall
pakeha rangatira came to Hokianga from Maketu&mdash;he
whose arm was strong as the lancewood of the hillside,
and whose counsel was wise in the day of battle.
I would have killed him, though my own life was
forfeit, had I not seen that <em>she</em> would follow him to
the reinga. But I could not cause a hair of her head
to be harmed, such was my bondage to her <i>mana</i>.
And you, O pakeha, will I save, likewise, for her sake.
Comfort yourself, O Erena; the pakeha will not die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it so? Truly do you say it?" almost gasped
the frenzied maid. "Is there anything more that we
can do? Have you the healing medicine for him?"</p>

<p>"I will prepare the bitter draught for him&mdash;that
draught which will bring a man back to life, though
the jaws of death were closing over him," said the
tohunga. "When the sun is high, a change will come
upon him."</p>

<p>"Are you sure? Are you indeed aware that he
will begin to gain strength?" she asked eagerly. "He
has been so terribly weak, and was beginning to lose
heart."</p>

<p>"Did the daughter of the Toa-rangatira ever know
my saying to prove false?" asked the priest, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no!" she rejoined hastily. "But tell
me more. Shall we be able to carry him to the homes
of his people? And shall we be happy afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I see," said the sage&mdash;"I see the pakeha standing
among his people; he is well; he is happy; joy
is in his face&mdash;in his voice. But there is blood&mdash;blood
through it. I can see no more. There is a
mist&mdash;a darkness. The future is hidden from me."</p>

<p>"A bad omen," said the girl, sadly. "You saw
blood, O Tiro-hanga! But I care not for myself, so
that <em>he</em> be safe and unharmed."</p>

<p>"Such is the woman who loves," mused the tohunga,
as he stalked moodily towards the shore of the lake&mdash;"of
whatever colour or race, in the old days as well
as in this present time, when chiefs are falling like
withered leaves, and the pakeha drives the tribes to
their death, as the wildfowl on the warm lakes. And
what cares she if the whole island is delivered to the
stranger, and we become his slaves? All her thought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>

is for the recovery of this pakeha, whom, till ten
moons since, she never set eyes upon."</p>

<p>With this moral reflection concerning the "eternal
feminine," the substance of which has been stated by
less recent philosophers, the magician of the period
betook himself to the raupo whare set apart for him,
where he remained long in deepest meditation, none
of the humbler members of the tribe daring to
disturb him.</p>

<p>He stayed till the close of the following day, to
watch the effect of his potion, and finding that
Massinger professed himself unaccountably improved
in mind and body, directed that in three days the
patient should commence his journey to the Oropi
missionary settlement, and departed mysteriously as
he had arrived.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The day was drawing to a close when a cry from
one of the Maori converts at the mission station of Oropi
informed the inmates of the approach of strangers.
Cyril Summers and his household still clung to their
lodge in the wilderness, in spite of the disquieting
rumours that evil was abroad, that murder and outrage
were still possible. As a matter of history, it has
always been stated that, even after the official surrender
of an enemy, and the disbandment of troops, guerilla
bands capable of the wildest excesses are formed,
recruited from the more desperate ruffians, whom only
the stern punishments of martial law could hold down.
Accustomed to comparative licence, often tacitly condoned
in time of war, and being&mdash;to give them their
due&mdash;often recklessly daring, their offences against discipline
are leniently judged. But when the excitement

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>

and the prizes of the campaign have been removed,
the period of enforced repose often appears to
the restless warrior of either side a season especially
arranged for the payment of outstanding grudges, or
the plunder of isolated homesteads. To the malevolent
and treacherous Ngarara, devoured with jealousy of
the pakeha preferred before him, it appeared as though
the demons of wrath and revenge, worshipped by his
ancestors, had delivered his rival into his hands. Infuriated
at hearing of his removal and partial recovery,
he had, by means of spies and kinsfolk, kept himself
well informed of Erena's movements. Fearing that
the wounded soldier would be withdrawn from his
powers of injury, he resolved upon a bold stroke, by
which he could free himself of his rival, and possess
himself of the girl, for whom he was but too willing
to sacrifice life itself.</p>

<p>Hypatia, ever alert to encounter the day's labours
or adventures, had been the first to hear the announcement
of the arrival. With Mr. Summers, she walked
towards the small party which, emerging from the
forest, came slowly along the path to the homestead.</p>

<p>"These are strangers," said he, looking earnestly
at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i>. "Three or four women, not more
than a dozen men, and some one, either weak or
wounded, carried in a litter. Who can they be? To
what tribe do they belong?" he asked of the Maori
servant woman who had followed them.</p>

<p>"Ngapuhi," said she confidently. "Rotorua natives,
some of them, going to the coast with sick man."</p>

<p>"Who is the girl walking by the litter?" asked
Hypatia, with quickened interest. "She is taller than
the other women."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most like Erena Mannering. Not sure; but walk
like her. Half-caste she is, daughter of war-chief.
Pakeha rangatira, belong to tribe all the same."</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder if this can be Lieutenant Massinger?"
said Summers. "He has not been seen
since the Gate Pah affair. This Erena Mannering was
reported to have carried him off, when he fell fighting
bravely beside Von Tempsky. His place of refuge
may have become insecure; for that or other reasons
they may wish to reach the coast."</p>

<p>Hypatia made no reply, but, walking quickly with
her companion, reached the bearers of the invalid, as
the girl, signing to them to halt, accosted Mr. Summers.</p>

<p>"You are the missionary of Oropi?" said she, in
perfectly good English, spoken with a purity of
intonation not always remarked in the colonists of
presumably higher education. "We are bringing a
Forest Ranger who was badly wounded at the Gate
Pah to the coast. Will you kindly allow us to rest for a
day? He is very low, and much fatigued by the journey."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Hypatia fixed her eyes, with feelings
alternating between astonishment and admiration,
upon this altogether amazing young person. Dressed,
or rather draped, like the native women who formed
part of the escort, without covering to head or feet,
the simple attire rather heightened than disguised
her beauty. Her free and haughty carriage, utterly
unconscious as she seemed of her unconventional attire,
the splendour of her glorious eyes, startled Hypatia,
while her graceful pose as she turned to explain the
situation reminded the English girl of the statue of
Diana which she had seen in the Pitti palace at Rome.</p>

<p>As the two girls faced each other, with the half-inquiring,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>

half-challenging regard of the partly conscious
rivals of their sex, they would have formed a
contrast, rarely met in such completeness, between the
finished aristocrat of the old world and this wondrous
embodiment of all the womanly graces, reared amid
the lonely lakes and wildwood glades of a far land.</p>

<p>Alike in beauty, though one possessed the blue
eyes, the abundant fair hair, the delicate rose-bloom
of the mother isle; the other the ebon tresses, the
flashing eyes, burning from time to time with a strange
lustre;&mdash;alike their classic figures and graceful movement,
each might have stood, had there been a
painter in attendance, as the realization of the glories
and graces of early womanhood.</p>

<p>Hypatia took the initiative. "Of course Mr.
Summers, all of us indeed, will be too happy to be of
service in such a sad case. And what is the name of
the wounded man? I am very pleased to meet you."</p>

<p>"And I also," said the Maori maiden. "You will
speak to him, will you not? Perhaps you may have
seen him before."</p>

<p>Walking to the litter, a rude but efficient couch,
Hypatia looked down upon the wounded soldier,
who tried feebly to raise himself. The wasted form
and drawn features of the sick man startled her,
while in the bearded face and pallid brow, from which
he feebly essayed to push back the clustering curls,
she almost failed to recognize Roland de Massinger.</p>

<p>For one moment she gazed in horror and dismay,
then taking his wasted hand and bending over his couch,
the once calm and self-repressed Hypatia Tollemache
covered her face with her hands and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"You know each other," said the forest maiden,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>

in a deep low voice. "I thought perhaps it might
be <em>you</em>&mdash;you for whose sake he came to our unhappy
land, for whose sake he now lies, perhaps dying."</p>

<p>"Erena!" said the sick man, "what are you
saying? Surely you are not angry with Miss Tollemache?
Is it her fault that I loved her once? Let it
be sufficient that now I love you. Give me your hand."</p>

<p>With a look of ineffable tenderness, she gave her
hand obediently as does a child.</p>

<p>"Miss Tollemache&mdash;Hypatia," he said, "she saved
my life; will you not be friends?"</p>

<p>A brighter gleam came into the tearful eyes of
the English girl. "You are more noble than I," she
said. "His life has been given to you, to save and
retain. Let us be sisters."</p>

<p>They clasped hands with the fervour of generous
youth, ere the passions that rend and ravage have
darkened the spirit. As their eyes met, the wounded
man looked up with a faint smile.</p>

<p>The state of Massinger's health necessitated more
than one day's sojourn at Oropi. However, on the
following morning a marked improvement had taken
place, so that it was decided in council that a farther
stage might be reached on the way to Tauranga
after the day's rest. The sufferer had been allotted
the chief guest-chamber, a modest apartment, but
exquisitely clean, whence looking forth on the mission
garden, the fruit trees and old-fashioned English
flowers recalled that beloved home-land which he
had almost despaired of seeing again.</p>

<p>At the evening meal Erena, who had caused one
of her dusky handmaidens to bring from the camp a
mysterious package, appeared in European costume.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>

Quietly but well dressed according to the fashion of
the day, it was a revelation to her entertainers and
to Hypatia to mark the ease and self-possession
which she exhibited in her new part. The soft rich
voice, the perfect intonation, the repose of her manner,
through which but an occasional flash of emotion
showed itself; the total absence of gesture which, in
her other habiliments, seemed natural to her;&mdash;all
these, as Hypatia admitted to herself, placed this
antipodean maiden on a perfect equality with the
best specimens of European society. When together
they saw to the comfort of their patient, nothing
could have surpassed the good taste and delicacy of
her ministrations. Without making parade of proprietorship
in the helpless sufferer, she assumed the rank
of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>, appearing equally confident of her companion's
acceptance of that of friend and well-wisher.</p>

<p>In the case of many other women, her frank trust
might possibly have been misplaced. But the justice
and generosity which were the leading qualities of
Hypatia Tollemache's nature, rendered her perfectly
safe as a companion, precluded by every impulse
from conspiring against her happiness.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Summers and her husband, they were
completely fascinated by her, holding that the
reputation which she enjoyed for beauty and intelligence
was even less than her due.</p>

<p>Hypatia, it may be, in the seclusion of her
chamber, reflected, as other maidens have been
known to do, on perhaps the too hasty dismissal of a
lover so brave, so loyal, in every respect so worthy
of woman's holiest devotion. She had, against her
heart's inclination, against his fervent appeals, resolved

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>

to give her life to the regeneration of the race, to
the reform of the social system, to the alteration of
a condition of things which the efforts of saints,
philosophers, rulers, and prophets throughout nearly
two thousand years had failed materially to change.
"Who was she," it now seemed to be inquired of her,
by an inward voice that would not be stilled, "that she
should presume to expect to move this colossal structure,
so firmly rooted in the usages of immemorial custom?"</p>

<p>In her first efforts, she had been discouraged and
disillusioned. In this her second endeavour, what
had she effected? As a direct result of her hasty
and inconsiderate action, Massinger had abandoned
home and friends, rushed away for distraction to this
Ultima Thule, at the very end of the habitable globe,
where he was now lying between life and death.
And, as if that was not a sufficiently dolorous
conclusion, his life had been saved by the courage
and devotion of another woman, to whom his faith
was justly, irrevocably pledged. The full bitterness of
her position was reached, when she acknowledged to
herself that in her heart of hearts she was now conscious
of feelings which before she had only suspected.</p>

<p>But Hypatia Tollemache, strong and deeply seated
as were her primal emotions, was no lovesick girl to
bewail herself over the inevitable; to chafe to morbid
unrest against Destiny, that ancient force, which even
the gods of an earlier world were powerless to disturb.
No! "a perfect woman nobly planned," she accepted
the blame of her mistaken act, as it now appeared to
her, and facing, as she had full many a time and oft
done before, an uncongenial part in life's mysterious
drama, resolved to follow unswervingly the path

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>

marked out for her by duty and principle. Was she to
falter, to fail, because the unexpected had happened;
because life's thorny path had become difficult, well-nigh
impenetrable? "If thou faint in the day of
adversity, thy strength is but small," said the wise
king. More than once in time of trial had she braced
up her courage by recalling the warning. Once more
she looked the conflict of the future firmly in the
face, and leaving her chamber with fixed resolve
and earnest prayer, felt a renewed confidence in her
ability to withstand, to undergo, whatever trials might
be in store for her.</p>

<p>On the following morning, which had been fixed
for the departure of the sick man and his attendants,
it was evident that another day would be required
for restoring his strength, which had been much drawn
upon by the journey. He was most anxious to proceed;
but Mr. Summers, who was not without some
knowledge of medicine, as well as practical experience,
distinctly forbade his removal. "It would be
most dangerous," he asserted; "and at least twenty-four
hours' additional rest was required before the
patient could think of pursuing the journey." Mrs.
Summers also pleaded with Erena, who, though manifestly
anxious to reach a place of safety, consented
to remain one more day.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is danger?" asked her gentle
hostess. "I thought the war was all over."</p>

<p>"The fight at Orakau is over, the last stand at
Te Ranga was made in vain; but the war is still in
the hearts of the Waikato and the Ngaiterangi," said
the Maori girl. "My father has enemies, and I, even
I, have those who wish me evil. There is one whom

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>

I fear for <em>his</em> sake"&mdash;here she intimated the room
wherein Massinger lay. "It is hard to know where
he will strike."</p>

<p>"But do you think he would come here?" said Mrs.
Summers, turning pale. "We have never done anything
but work and teach and pray for the welfare of
the natives."</p>

<p>"When blood has been once shed, there is little
thought of good or evil. And besides the old custom
of revenge, a new religion has sprung up among the
tribes, called the 'Pai Marire.' They have a false
prophet, Te Ua, who persuades them that the pakehas
are doomed to destruction. They also carry about with
them the head of an officer of the 57th, whom they surprised
at Ahuahu, and perform sacred rites around it."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful thing!" said Mrs. Summers,
rapidly approaching a state of terror and amazement.
"But surely they have always spared the missionaries?"</p>

<p>"The new teaching is that all the missionaries are
to be killed," said the girl. "We have heard that
Mr. Grace has been threatened, and Mr. Fulloon's
house burned."</p>

<p>"But will not the troops protect us?" urged Mrs.
Summers. "I thought they were quite close now?"</p>

<p>"They have marched to Te Awamutu. I was
told so by a native woman yesterday," said Erena.
"She said, besides, that Ngarara, the man who has
sworn to revenge himself upon Roland, is out with a
<i>taua</i>, or war-party, and may at any time surprise us."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is the reason you were so anxious
to get on?"</p>

<p>"Partly, yes. And, besides, I did not wish to
bring trouble on your household. But we must go

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>

forward tomorrow, and perhaps what I am afraid of
may never come to pass."</p>

<p>The day was mild and pleasant, though a louring
sky had promised otherwise in the early part of the
morning. Massinger was able to be moved into the
sitting-room, and there, refreshed by his morning
meal and the change of situation, declared that he
felt strong enough to travel in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"We have arranged otherwise," said Erena, with
a mock assumption of authority. "One day will not
make much difference. I am going to the camp for
an hour, so I will leave you to the care of Miss
Tollemache." Here she smiled playfully at Hypatia,
who had just entered the room. "I dare say you are
anxious to have a talk together."</p>

<p>"How trusting and unsuspicious she is!" thought
Hypatia. "Having once received his troth, she is absolutely
sure of his fidelity. She has a noble nature, and,
from me at least, she need not fear any disloyalty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Summers had already left the room. Then
the man and the maiden who had last met under
such widely different circumstances in another land,
were once more free to have speech, undisturbed by
the presence of onlookers.</p>

<p>But for this forest nymph, so sweet, so strong, so
impossible to condemn, how differently even yet
might their romance have ended! But the knight
was in the toils of the Queen of Faerye, and to Elfland
he must fare, under pain of death, or transformation
to a being that even <i>she</i> could not recognize.
A creature false to his plighted troth, ungrateful to
the girl who had saved his life at the risk of her own,
whose love he had won. A love not transient and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>

fleeting, like so many affected by the women of his
race, founded upon vanity, ambition, greed of wealth
or rank, but changeless, immortal, strong as death,
true to the grave, even to the dark realm beyond it.</p>

<p>Hypatia had probed and purified her heart, and
she felt, though she loved him now with a force and
passionate feeling hitherto unsuspected, that she could
not for worlds have accepted his hand, even had he
offered it.</p>

<p>They were now two different people. She, after
trial, change, and the bitterness of lost illusions, had
vowed herself to the life-devotion which succeeds the
sanguine expectation of mighty work among the
heathen. He, the haggard, war-worn soldier, sick unto
death and sore wounded&mdash;ah! so unlike the trim
sportsman and correctly attired country gentleman of
the old half-forgotten life.</p>

<p>He was the first to speak. She gazed on him with
the pitying tenderness of womanhood shining through
her troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"A strange meeting, Miss Tollemache, in a strange
land!" he said, with a brave attempt to smile. "Rather
a change from Hereford here! Who would have
thought of seeing <em>you</em> here, of all people?"</p>

<p>She made haste to reply, lest the unshed tears
should resist all efforts to control them. She would
have thrown herself on her knees by the side of his
couch and clasped his wasted hand, had she dared
to give vent to her feelings. Then she spoke lightly,
though her mouth quivered with the effort.</p>

<p>"Isn't it hard to say where you may fall in with
any given man, or woman either, if it comes to that,
in these exciting days?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly you are the last person I ever expected
to see here," he made answer, half musingly. "In
New Zealand of all places, and at this particular
mission station!"</p>

<p>"It is easy of explanation. I was tired of London
life&mdash;disillusioned, if you will. You prophesied it,
you may remember; and hearing from my old schoolfellow,
Mary Summers, that she was hard pressed for
help in her work, took my passage, and here I am."</p>

<p>"So I see," he replied gravely. "And from what
I have heard lately, I heartily wish that you were
anywhere else."</p>

<p>"But, surely, if there be danger&mdash;and I suppose
you mean that&mdash;I have no more right to be shielded
than another."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Summers, whom I deeply respect, has
followed her husband in the path of a plain duty.
But why <em>you</em>, without ties or adequate reason, should
have volunteered for this forlorn hope, I cannot
comprehend. It is the personal sacrifice which has a
charm for some women, I suppose," he went on.</p>

<p>"And for some men," she retorted, "else why
should <em>you</em> be here, wounded almost to the death in
a quarrel in which you had no share, and which I
believe in my heart you consider unjust. When will
men come to understand that women differ widely
among themselves, and are attracted, even as they
are, by novelty and adventure?"</p>

<p>"Mine is only a man's answer, and scarcely logical
either, but it is the best I have. I came to New
Zealand because I could not live in England. Like
you, I had lost a world of hope, trust, and fond illusion.
This war was commenced without my consent

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>

or support, but finding myself between two camps, I
chose the British one."</p>

<p>"It was very natural," she said with a sigh. "But
tell me of yourself. How were you wounded, and
why did you not remain at the camp?"</p>

<p>"I should have remained there altogether," he
said, with a flickering smile, "had it not been for
Erena and her two cousins. We met with a reverse
at the Gate Pah, and every man that fell near me was
tomahawked within two minutes. These girls rushed
in through a hail of bullets and dragged me into the
high fern, where I lay safely until some of the Ngapuhi
joined them. They carried me to a cave only known
to the tohunga and a few individuals of the tribe."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"I found next morning that the bleeding had been
stopped and the wound bandaged. Since then I have
been terribly weak, but am now recovering slowly, <em>very</em>
slowly. To-day I feel better than I have done for some
time past. I shall pick up as soon as we reach the shore."</p>

<p>"May God grant it," she replied. "If it was through
any act of mine that you quitted home and friends, I
should feel that your blood was on my head. When
I think of your renunciation, I cannot help doubting
whether any woman is worth the sacrifice. And now
we must say farewell. You are to leave at dawn, I
hear; so if we are doomed never to meet again, think
kindly of Hypatia Tollemache, and believe that you
have her best wishes, her prayers."</p>

<p>As she spoke she held out her hand, which he
clasped in his; so thin and wasted was it that the
tears rose to her eyes. He pressed his lips passionately
to it, and relinquished the slender fingers with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>It was late when Erena returned. The little
household was assembled at the evening meal when
she entered the room, and, declining to join the
repast, stood with a countenance troubled and darkly
boding before she spoke. So might Cassandra, as
she stood before the Trojan host in high-walled Ilion.</p>

<p>"Bad news!" she said abruptly. "So bad that
it could hardly be worse. This Hau-Hau sect is
gaining ground. They are carrying round Captain
Boyd's head to stir up the tribes; they have murdered
Mr. Volkner, and are marching towards the
coast. No one can tell where they will strike next."</p>

<p>The countenances of the women blanched as this
announcement was made. Mr. Summers, though
visibly affected, preserved his composure, as he
asked where the dreadful deed took place.</p>

<p>"At Opotiki," said Erena. "He came in a vessel,
though he was warned not to do so. He and Mr.
Grace, another missionary, were at once taken
prisoners, and Mr. Volkner was hanged on a willow
tree by Kereopa; the tribe assenting."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance of their coming here?"
said Mr. Summers. "We have never had the
slightest altercation with the tribes. I have been
here since 1850, and every thought of my heart,
every word from my lips, has been with the object
of their benefit. No chief would permit such an
outrage, such an unheard-of crime."</p>

<p>"You do not know Kereopa," replied Erena.
"He is one of those natives who go perfectly mad
when their blood is up, and think no more of killing
any man, woman, or child near him than you people
do of wringing the neck of a <i>kea</i>. Besides, Te Ua,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>

who has declared himself to be a prophet, boasts of
a message from the angel Gabriel, that the sword
of the Lord and Gideon is committed into the hands
of the Pai Marire, with which to smite the pakeha
and the unfaithful Maoris. But I have sent one who
will put Ropata on their track; if <em>he</em> comes up with
them, they will learn more of Old Testament law."</p>

<p>"A day of rebuke and blasphemy, murder and
outrage," groaned Cyril Summers. "And is this
to be the end of our labours? I feel inclined,
though it is putting one's hand to the plough and
turning back, to make for the coast until matters
are more peaceful. What do you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"My people and I, with Mr. Massinger, will start
at midnight," said the girl, decisively. "I wish now
that we had left this morning. I implore of you to
leave with your family at the same time."</p>

<p>"But the road in the darkness?" said Summers.
"The forest is difficult to thread by daylight."</p>

<p>"To our guide," said Erena, "the night is as the day.
We shall keep on steadily until we reach Tauranga."</p>

<p>"I am tempted to join forces with you," he said.
"But no! we must show the natives that we believe
what we have taught them&mdash;that God is able to save
those who trust in Him. Mary, Hypatia, you had
better go with Erena's party, and take the children."</p>

<p>The delicate form of Mary Summers seemed to
gain height and dignity as, with all the devoted
courage of her "deep love's truth" shining in her
steadfast eyes, she said, "I have but to repeat the
words I spoke in the church where our lives were
joined&mdash;'till death do us part.' My place is by you,
my darling, here and hereafter. May God protect
us all in this dread hour!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Miss Tollemache?" said Erena, addressing
Hypatia. "Will <em>you</em> wait for the coming of the
Hau-Haus&mdash;to be carried off as a slave, perhaps?"
and here her piercing gaze seemed to read Hypatia's
inmost soul. "You do not know what that means;
I do! Taunts and blows, water to draw, burdens
to carry, degradation unspeakable!"</p>

<p>The English girl drew herself up and returned
the fixed regard of the daughter of the South with
a look as unblenching as her own, ere she answered,
calmly, almost haughtily&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I promised my friends to be a fellow-labourer
with them, I made no reservations. I have
cast in my lot with them, and will share their fortunes,
even to the martyr's death, if it be so ordained."</p>

<p>Erena watched her with an expression of surprise
which changed to frank admiration.</p>

<p>"Farewell, O friends," she said; "may God protect
you from all evil. As for you, you are worthy of his
friendship, of his <em>love</em>."</p>

<p>As she made the last gesture of farewell, she
stooped, and taking Hypatia's unresisting hand,
raised it to her lips and glided from the room.</p>

<p>It was no time for sleep. Praying and conversing
by turns, the household awaited the departure of the
little band. From the verandah they watched the
bearers emerge from Massinger's room with the couch.
This they placed upon the litter on which he had lain
for so many a weary mile. They saw Erena take her
place beside it as the bearers moved silently away. A
dark form glided before them on the narrow path, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i> followed through the darksome arches of the
forest, and was swallowed up in the midnight gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>After their departure, the household engaged in
prayer. When Cyril Summers addressed the Almighty
Disposer of events in earnest supplication
that His servants might be spared the last terrible
penalties of savage warfare, it cannot be doubted that
each hearer's inmost heart responded most fervently
to the appeal. Mrs. Summers wept as, with her hand
in her husband's, she echoed his cry for deliverance,
and rising from her knees with streaming eyes, threw
her arms around Hypatia's neck.</p>

<p>"We have brought you into these horrors," she said.
"Oh, why did I ever encourage you to come to this
fatal shore?"</p>

<p>From Hypatia's eyes there fell no tears. An
intense and glowing lustre seemed to burn in her
deep blue eyes, as she gazed into the distance, as one
who sees what is hid from ordinary mortals. One
could fancy her a virgin martyr in the days of Nero,
receiving her summons to the arena. Unquestioning
faith, dauntless courage, and an almost divine pity,
made radiant her countenance as she looked on Mary
Summers and her sleeping children.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of what man can do to us," she
said softly. "The God whom we serve has power to
deliver us in this dread hour. Did not Erena say
that a body of the Ngapuhi men were marching on the
track of the Hau-Hau band? 'Oh, rest in the Lord,
and He will give thee thy heart's desire.' As her sweet
voice rose, and the beautiful words of Mendelssohn's
immortal work resounded through the room, a ray of
hope illumined the forlorn household, as with a final
hand-clasp all retired to their couches, though not to
sleep."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hour before dawn, when "deep sleep falls upon
men," found the whole household wrapped in that
slumber which was the natural outcome of an anxious
and exciting day. But the quick loud bark of an
angry dog, subsiding into a sustained suspicious growl,
and joined to a woman's scream from the camp of
their native adherents, told Cyril Summers that the
enemy was at hand. A confused murmur of voices,
the trampling of feet, with the ordinary indefinable
accompaniments of a body of men, aroused the sleepers
with startling suddenness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Summers and Hypatia, like women on a
sinking ship, displayed unwonted courage. Dressing
themselves and the wondering children in haste, they
joined Mr. Summers in the living-room of the cottage
at the same moment that it was filled by an excited
crowd of the wildest natives which any of the party
had ever seen.</p>

<p>The leader, a ferocious-looking Maori, whom Mr.
Summers had no difficulty in recognizing as Kereopa,
advanced with threatening air towards him; but, seeing
that the missionary had no weapon, nor apparently
the wish or means to defend himself, he halted
abruptly. Behind him stood a crowd of natives, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>

greater part of whom had advanced into the room,
while others could be seen through the open door
between the cottage and the outbuildings. Looking
more closely in order to discover if by chance
there were among them any of his former servants,
Mr. Summers saw, to his horror and disgust, a white
man. This renegade, dead to every feeling of manhood,
a deserter from his regiment, was one of those
abandoned wretches to be found in all new countries,
who, associating with savages, encourage them in
outrage and rapine. Outcasts from their race, aware
that a speedy death by bullet or halter awaits them
on capture, they have always been noted as the most
remorseless foes of their own people.</p>

<p>Feeling, however, that by interrogating the man
he might procure more accurate information than from
the dangerously excited chief and his followers, he
addressed him.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this intrusion at this hour?
Ask Kereopa if he has not made some mistake."</p>

<p>The renegade, apparently pleased at being civilly
addressed, translated the question, and repeated it to
the chief, who in a loud and threatening voice replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell the Mikonaree that I, a prophet of the
Pai Marire, have received authority from the angel
Gabriel to kill or take into captivity all the pakehas,
with their wives and daughters, as did the Israelites
with the Amalekites."</p>

<p>"Have I ever done you harm? Have I not taught
your people to grow the bread-grain, the potato, the
vegetables on which they grow strong and healthy?"</p>

<p>"What have you done&mdash;what have the white men
done?" shouted the wild-eyed chief, now working

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>

himself into an insane fury. "You have taught us
your prayers and stolen our lands. You have given
us the grain and taken the fields. Where are our
brothers, our sons, our chiefs? Slain by your soldiers,
after robbing them of their lands&mdash;even Waitara and
Tataraimaka. They are cold in the ground on which
they planted and feasted, but which now only serves
them for graves."</p>

<p>"Surely you would not kill people with no arms
in their hands. Which of our missionaries has ever
fired a gun even in defence of his life?"</p>

<p>"The priests of your people do not fight, but
they act as spies; they have betrayed our plans to
the pakeha general. They will all be killed, like
Volkner, to show the world that we shall have no
spies, no false prophets, no priests of Baal, amongst
us. Prepare to die, even as Volkner died, whose
head, with that of the pakeha Boyd, is with us. Let
their hands be tied."</p>

<p>At once several eager warriors sprang forward, by
whom the women and the missionary were seized.
Their hands were bound behind them with strips of
the native flax, which effectively rendered them
helpless captives.</p>

<p>"You will die when the sun goes down," he said,
indicating Cyril Summers. "Call on your God to
help you. The rope is ready, and the tree on which
you will hang, as did Volkner. But all are not here.
Where is the wounded pakeha, and the Ngapuhi girl
Erena?"</p>

<p>"They have gone; they went yesterday."</p>

<p>"Which path was theirs? If you deceive me, great
suffering will be yours before you die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>"They went into the forest; that is all I can say.
The God in whom I trust will save me from cruelty
at your hands."</p>

<p>A native at this time said some words in the
Maori tongue which seemed for the time to allay the
wrath of the raging wild beast into which Kereopa
was transformed.</p>

<p>"It is well. Their tracks will be found; Ngarara
is a keen hunter when the prey is near. He is
pursuing the Ngapuhi girl Erena, whose heart the
pakeha soldier has stolen from him. He will cut <em>his</em>
heart out of his breast and eat it before her eyes. I
will give her to him for a slave. All the pakeha
women shall be slaves to the men of the Pai Marire
when the day of deliverance shall come. <i>Hau-Hau,
Hau-Hau, Hau-Hau!</i>"</p>

<p>Here the countenance of the half-insane savage
became changed into the likeness of a ferocious beast,
as he yelled out the war-cry of the sect, which was
immediately caught up and re-echoed, dog-like, by
every individual in the maniacal crowd. With eyes
almost reversed in their sockets, with tongue protruding,
with the foam flying from his lips, and every
human feature lost in the bestial transformation, he
resembled less a human being than a monstrous
demon from the lowest pit of Acheron.</p>

<p>Mrs. Summers fainted, the children screamed
piteously, and Cyril made one step forward, as if,
even with his fettered hands, he essayed to do battle
with the destroying fiend. He was immediately seized
by two powerful natives, who had been standing near
him, and forced back to his former position. Realizing
his utter helplessness, he groaned aloud as he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>

saw Hypatia bending over his wife's drooping form,
while she adjured her to preserve her presence of
mind for the sake of the terrified children and her
unhappy husband.</p>

<p>"We shall need all our strength to carry us through
this ordeal," she said. "We need it for prayer and
faith, which, even in this dark hour, will save us."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the brave spirit of the devoted wife
and mother recalled her to life and consciousness. She
gazed on the strange surroundings of their once peaceful
home, and after giving vent to her emotions in one
wild burst of tears, resumed her efforts at composure.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the overwrought feelings of the
captives, a diversion at this critical moment was
effected through an unusual noise beginning among
the natives clustered beyond and around the open
door. A cry, whether of warning or triumph, came
from the forest path; gradually it swelled into greater
distinctness, until it resolved itself into the well-known
shout of triumph which proclaimed the capture of an
enemy of note. It was then seen, by the full dawn
light now breaking through the masses of gloom, to
proceed from a body of men emerging from the
forest. The leaders of the party were dancing and
singing with an exuberance which betokened victory
and triumph. When the whole body debouched from
the wood, it was seen to have in its midst a litter
borne by four men, beside whom walked a girl with
haughty and defiant mien. She looked more like a
barbaric queen than a captive taken in war, as her
fettered wrists showed her to be. Her attendants had
been similarly treated, with the exception of the
bearers, who were so closely surrounded that their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>

escape had been considered improbable. By the time
they had reached the open space behind the cottage,
the whole party, including Kereopa, had quitted
the room, and joined in the tremendous volume of
triumphant yells and cries which rent the air.</p>

<p>"Let the pakeha wahine come forth and look upon
their friends," said Kereopa, with devilish malice.
"They will see how the prophets of the Pai Marire
obey the message of the angels, how the sword of the
Lord and Gideon is made sharp for the evil-doer, and
how the convert from the Ngapuhi is rewarded in the
hour of victory."</p>

<p>Fearful of further violence, Cyril Summers had
partially supported his wife, followed by the shuddering
children, to the porch, around which in happier days
he had pleased himself with training a clematis.
Hypatia stepped forward with wide eyes, as expectant
of instant tragedy. Almost unheeding of her own
danger, and the fearful position in which all were
placed, she could not repress her interest in Massinger,
as with almost equal eagerness she looked at Erena.
He lay back on the rude pillow which had been
placed below his head, deathly pale, and only exhibiting
consciousness through his heaving breast and
the movements of his eyes. But when she turned her
gaze upon the dauntless form of Erena Mannering,
all womanly jealousy was obliterated by the glow of
admiration which the girl's regal bearing and fearless
spirit evoked in her. She moved among the fierce
crowd of half-doubtful, half-bloodthirsty Hau-Haus
with the air of a princess among pariahs. Upon those
who pressed closely to her side she from time to time
bestowed a glance of scorn and menace, accompanied

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>

by a few words in their own tongue, from which they
shrank as from a missile. Her eyes blazed as they
were turned upon Kereopa, who with sneering smile
approached her, pointing to the half-inanimate form
of Massinger.</p>

<p>"The pakeha is sick; the pakeha is tired," he
said with affected regret. "It is wrong that he was
carried so far. His wound must be unhealed. The
Pai Marire grieve. <em>He will not stand the fire well</em>,
tomorrow. There will be a <i>haka</i> too, in honour of
Ngarara's marriage, which he must first witness."</p>

<p>"Dog of the Hau-Haus!" said the indignant
maiden, with all the scorn and wrath of a line of
chiefs shining from her storm-litten eyes. "Speak
you to a war-chief's daughter of the Ngapuhi as to a
slave-woman? What false tohunga have ye, that
thy doom and that of thy herd of swine is concealed
from thee? See thy future fate, as in that darkening
cloud, coming nearer and yet nearer!" As she
spoke, she pointed to a thunder-cloud which, after the
mists of the morning, had gathered size and volume,
and was now moving with the course of the dawn-wind
towards them. Such was the majesty of her
mien, such the tragic earnestness of her tones, as she
stood, like a priestess of old, denouncing wrong and
oppression, that the crowd, deeply superstitious as is
the race, turned instinctively towards the approaching
phenomenon; and when the thunder rolled, and the
jagged fire-stream issued from the ebon, a shuddering
sound was audible, which showed how deeply fear of
the supernatural was rooted in the native mind.
"Behold!" said the fearless, inspired maiden, as she
raised her hand and pointed to the sky, "the Atua

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>

of the Storm has spoken! Beware how you touch a
hair of our heads. Shed the blood of these pakehas,
who have never done your nation aught but good, who
are now helpless in your hands&mdash;torture this sick
soldier&mdash;and not a man here will be alive when the
moon is dark!"</p>

<p>As Erena uttered the words of doom, she paused
for a moment, while the audience gazed around, as if
waiting for some physical manifestation in answer to
her words. Kereopa preserved his expression of
malicious unbelief, as though willing to torment his
captives with all the dreadful uncertainty which might
comport with a treacherous delay. Glancing at him
for a moment with unutterable scorn, she left her
position, and, moving to the side of the litter, gazed
into the face of the sick man with anxious tenderness.</p>

<p>But it was evident that the natives generally had
attached more meaning to her words than could have
been expected. She had stirred their blood and
aroused their superstitious fears. This killing of
pakehas, except in fair fight, had always been regarded
as unlucky. Terrible penalties had been exacted,
even when the offence in war-time had seemed to
them trifling and unimportant. Then, this Erena
Mannering was the daughter of a man more fierce
and implacable even than their own warriors&mdash;a war-chief
of the Ngapuhi, and as such likely to exact a
memorable revenge. The Pai Marire was only of
recent date. There were even now rival seers and
prophets, as in the case of Parata, who withstood
Kereopa, and had bitterly reproached him for the
barbarous murder of the missionary Volkner. There
was a movement of doubt and opposition afoot, which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>

was evidently strengthened, as an aged warrior came
forward and addressed the natives.</p>

<p>"Men of the Pai Marire," he said, "let us beware
of going too far in this matter, lest we offend a more
powerful Atua than those of the Hau-Haus, whom we
knew of but a short while since. If we kill the
soldiers of the pakehas, who have killed our sons and
brothers"&mdash;here the old man's features worked convulsively&mdash;"taken
our lands, and burned our kaingas,
that is just, that is <i>utu</i>. But to kill the Mikonaree,
who fights not with guns or swords, who teaches the
children the pukapuka, who heals the sick and
feeds the hungry, that is not <i>tika</i>. The Atua of the
Storm has spoken." Here another volley of heaven's
artillery shook the air, as the lightning played in
menacing proximity to the disturbed and upturned
faces of his hearers. "Beware lest worse things than
the slaughter of chiefs at Te Ranga happen to us."</p>

<p>A strong feeling of indecision was now apparent in
the excited crowd, who but an hour since were eager
for blood and flames, the death of the men, the leading
into captivity of the women and children. It is
possible that the mass vote of the Hau-Haus would
have gone against Kereopa, who was not an hereditary
chief of importance, only an obscure individual,
lifted by superior cunning and energy to power in
disturbed times. But at that moment the malignant
face of Ngarara was seen to emerge from among the
last arrivals, and his voice was heard.</p>

<p>"Men of the Pai Marire, listen not to the words
of age and fear! He speaks the words of the pakehas
and their lying priests. The prophets of the Pai Marire
have foretold that the Hau-Haus are to rule the land,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>

to drive the pakeha into the sea, whence in an evil
hour they came, to inhabit their towns, and to take their
wives and daughters as slaves. Even now, the Ngatitoa
are marching to Omata, whence they will capture
Taranaki with all the pakeha's treasure. It has been
foretold that the Pai Marire shall increase as the sands
of the sea, that all the tribes shall join from the
Hokianga to Korararika. I have left the Ngapuhi
to follow the Pai Marire, and I know that the tribe,
except a few old men, have resolved to abandon Waka
Nene and his pakeha friends, and to give the young
chiefs authority to lead. You have but to join the march
to Waikato, and the land of Maui is yours again."</p>

<p>"You have well spoken," shouted Kereopa, whose
fierce visage was now aflame with wrath, and the half-insane
gleam of whose eyes told of that fanatical
ecstasy which is akin to demoniacal possession. "The
land will be ours, the pakeha's treasures shall be
ours; his women shall work in our fields and carry
burdens, even as the women of the South were wont
to do after our raids. Place the head on the <i>niu</i>,
and let the war-dance begin. The angel has again
spoken to me, and I am commanded to cause the
sword of the Lord and Gideon to be reddened with
the blood of the Amorites."</p>

<p>Then commenced a scene of savage triumph,
appalling, revolting, almost beyond the power of words
to describe. The fury of the excited natives appeared
to have transformed them into the brutish presentments
of the herd of animals which surrounded the
fabled enchantress. The head of the unfortunate
Captain Boyd, raised on a pole planted in the ground,
was surrounded by a yelling mass dancing around it,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>

with fiendish gestures of rage and derision. All
likeness of manhood seemed obliterated, and the
ancient world would seem to have been reproduced,
with a company of anthropoids devoid of human
speech, and capable only of the purely animal expression
of the baser passions.</p>

<p>What the feelings of the forlorn captives were,
thus delivered into the hands of the most remorseless
foes of their race, can scarcely be imagined or described.
They deemed themselves at that moment
to be abandoned by man, forgotten of God. A
dreadful death, horrors unspeakable, degradation
irrevocable, awaited them. Like a fated crew awaiting
their doom upon a sinking ship, all sensation was
perhaps deadened, absorbed in despairing expectation
of the last agony immediately preceding death.</p>

<p>The Christians summoned from their cells to the
arena in the reign of Nero must have had like
experiences. Alike the agony of despair, the doubt
of Eternal Justice, the shrinking of the frail flesh
about to be delivered to the hungry beasts of prey, the
torturing flame, the gloating regard of the pitiless populace.
All these were apparently to be their portion
in this so-called civilized century, this boasted age of
light, of freedom, of art, and intellectual environment.</p>

<p>Similar thoughts may have passed through the
mind of Hypatia Tollemache, as she recalled her
classical studies, and saw the blood-soaked arena of the
Roman amphitheatre before her, of which the essential
features were now in rude and grotesque presentment.</p>

<p>And had it all come to this? Was all the labour,
the self-denial, the toilsome day, the weary night, the
exile, the home-sickness, but to end thus? Not for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>

herself did she mourn, perhaps, so much; not for the
warrior maid, whose high courage and inherited traditions
enabled her to defy insult and brave death.
They had courted the danger and must now pay the
price. With Massinger, too, his chief regret would be
that he could not stand in the ranks as at Rangariri
and Orakau, dealing death around, and fighting breast
to breast with the ruthless foe. And though death
by tortures, dreadful and protracted, such as all had
heard of in old Maori wars (and it was whispered around
camp-fires was not wholly obsolete), was gruesome and
unnatural, still it was, in a rude sense, the payment
lawfully exacted by the victors. But for these mild
and gentle teachers of the Word, who had, for nearly
a decade, wearied every faculty of mind and body in
the service of their heathen destroyers, it was indeed a
hard and cruel fate. She saw, in imagination, Cyril
Summers dragged to the fatal tree, with the rope
around his neck, as was that steadfast servant of the
Lord, Carl Volkner. She saw the ashen face and
stricken limbs of Mary Summers, as, all-expectant of
her own and her children's fate, she would witness the
death and mutilation of her beloved partner. What
was the mercy, the justice, of that Supreme Being to
whom they had bowed the knee in prayer since infancy,
where was an overruling Providence, if this tragedy was
permitted to be played out to the last dreadful scene?
Where, alas! could one turn for aid or consolation?</p>

<p>Such thoughts went coursing through her brain,
mingled with such curious and even trifling observation,
unconsciously made, as during the fast-fleeting
moments of life have often been noted to occupy the
mind. She looked mechanically at the war-dance

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>

still being performed by the exulting savages, varied
by the devilish rites, if such they could be called,
performed around the dead officer's head, which with
awful eyes appeared to stare down upon the unholy
crew. Cyril Summers and his wife were kneeling in
prayer; the children, having exhausted themselves in
weeping, were examining the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of their household
gods. Hypatia herself, with her masses of bright hair
thrown back from her face, and carelessly tied in a
knot behind her head, was leaning against the doorsill,
in position not unlike the Christian maiden in a
great picture, where each martyr is bound to a pillar
in the amphitheatre, when she saw Erena move more
closely to Massinger's couch and whisper in his ear.
The Maori guard was temporarily occupied, as an
expert, in noting the evolutions of the war-dance, and
had relaxed his watch. The sick man lay motionless,
but the languid eyes opened; a gleam of hope&mdash;or was
it the fire of despair?&mdash;was visible, with a slight change
of expression.</p>

<p>"She knows something; she has told him," thought
Hypatia, as she moved cautiously but slowly, and very
warily, within hearing.</p>

<p>At this time the supreme saltatory expression of
triumph was being enacted. The noise was deafening, so
that the clear tones of Erena's rich voice were audible.</p>

<p>"This is nearly the end of the war-dance; then
the murders and the torture will commence. The
torture will last all night; they will take out Roland
and tie him to a stake, cutting pieces of flesh from his
body. Poor fellow! there is not much on his bones. As
for us, we shall be carried away to the Uriwera country."</p>

<p>"You want to frighten me to death," said Hypatia.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>

"What dreadful things even to speak of! Can we
not kill ourselves? I never thought I should wish to
do that. I can now feel for others who have done so."</p>

<p>"They have prevented it. Our hands are tied.
There is no river here; no precipice, or we could
throw ourselves over, as our women have often done."</p>

<p>"You seem strangely indifferent, Erena. I cannot
think you heartless; but on the verge of death, or a
captivity infinitely worse, surely you cannot jest about
our position?"</p>

<p>"Far from it. My whole heart is quivering with
excitement and anxiety; for <em>his</em> life, which I value a
thousand times more than my own, is trembling in the
balance. But, after all, I do not really think these
dreadful things will come to pass."</p>

<p>"Why? What reason have you?"</p>

<p>"You remember that I came in late, the day after
our arrival&mdash;on the day when I wished to go on with
our journey?"</p>

<p>"Now I do remember. You looked as though you
had been a long way."</p>

<p>"I had indeed. I went back on our tracks very
nearly as far as the cave where Roland lay concealed,
when we brought him away from the Gate Pah. I
thought I might meet some of my father's people, who
would have made short work of these bloodthirsty
Hau-Haus. But he had gone off towards Opotiki, as
a report had come of another rising. But luckily I
met some one, and it will go far to save our lives."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked Hypatia, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"It was Winiata. He had heard of these Hau-Haus
being on the march, and that Ngarara had
persuaded Kereopa to follow us up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what aid did he give you?"</p>

<p>"Merely this&mdash;that a body of Ngatiporu were
following up this <i>taua</i>, led by the most dreaded
warrior in all New Zealand, Ropata Waha Waha."</p>

<p>At the mention of this name, so well known
throughout the length and breadth of New Zealand&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"In close fight a champion grim,</span>
      <span class="i3">In camps a leader sage"&mdash;</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hypatia could hardly repress a cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps we may be saved, after all."</p>

<p>"If he comes in time; and God grant he may. He
should be very close now. And I know Winiata will
travel without rest or food till he strikes his trail.
And yet I have a foreboding that one of us will die.
So said the tohunga, whose words never failed yet. I
cannot shake off the feeling."</p>

<p>"You have overworked yourself," said Hypatia.
"You can have had little rest, food, or sleep since you
left yesterday. It is the result of fatigue and anxiety."</p>

<p>"Anxiety has too often been my lot," said the girl,
with a deep accent of sadness. "But fatigue I never
felt yet. These wretches are spinning out their dance.
They had better make the most of it. If all goes
well, it is the last some of them will ever join in.
Now, listen! Do you hear nothing?"</p>

<p>Hypatia bent her ear towards the forest, and
listened with all the eagerness which the situation
demanded. A faint murmur once, and once only,
made itself audible.</p>

<p>"It is the sound of the breeze among the pines,"
said she at length.</p>

<p>"Listen again! Do you hear nothing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only a far-off sound like the rippling of the river.
Once I thought I heard the trampling of feet; but it
must be a mistake."</p>

<p>"It is no mistake," said Erena. "I hear the steady
tramp of a large body of men; and so would these
fools, if they were not too much occupied with their
absurd dance, which they intend to finish up with
blood. And so it will; but not as they think."</p>

<p>The war-dance, with its stamps and roars, its
shuddering hisses and accurate evolutions as if of one
man, was drawing to a close. Already one of the
foremost warriors, at a sign from Kereopa, had placed
a rope round the neck of Cyril Summers, who had
commenced in a final prayer to commend his soul
and his loved ones to the protection of their Maker,
when a shout from a number of unknown voices made
the forest ring, and caused the crowd of Hau-Haus
to turn their faces in that direction. At the same
moment a close and well-directed volley was poured
in, which laid fully one-half of them low, and wounded
a much larger number. Then a man stalked calmly
forward, sword in hand, whose sudden apparition
created as much consternation among the Hau-Haus
as if he had been a Destroying Angel specially
commissioned for their extirpation. One look at the
stern features and martial form of him who stood
calm and unmoved amid the pattering hail of bullets,
with which the Hau-Haus strove to return the fire,
was sufficient for most of the Pai Marire. With a
wild cry of "Ropata Waha Waha!" which came
tremulously from their lips, they fled in all directions
in a state of the most abject terror. And well might
they or other rebels take panic at the sight of him who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>

stood exposed to danger, both from friends and foes,
as though the thick-flying bullets were thistledown.</p>

<p>The hostile tribes were fully of opinion that he
bore a charmed life, that no shot had power to harm
him, probably in consequence of Satanic influence.
Hence his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i> of Waha Waha was strangely
suggestive of an unholy alliance between the Prince
of Darkness and the cool strategist and remorseless
warrior, to whom fear and mercy were alike unknown.
A target for the best marksmen in a hundred fights,
himself chiefly unarmed, he had never received a
wound or spared an enemy. As he stood there, with
an expression of scorn and concentrated rage upon
his expressive features, with dripping sword and
blazing eyes, he might well have stood for a portrait
of an avenging angel, or indeed Azrael, the minister
of Death, in all his lurid majesty.</p>

<p>Kereopa and his principal followers, who had fled
at the first onset, probably thought that they had a
fair chance of escape. But Ropata, with his usual
astuteness, had formed a cordon around the Hau-Hau
band, into which the surprised natives ran, only
to find themselves shot down or captured. Among
the latter were eleven members of his own tribe, the
Aowera. Of these he proceeded to make an example
upon the spot. Calling them out of the group of
captives by name, he thus addressed them&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are about to die. I do not kill you because
you are found in arms against the pakehas. But I
forbade you to join the Hau-Haus. You have disobeyed
me; you must now pay the penalty."</p>

<p>Having revolvers handed to him, he then shot
every man with his own hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bring forward the deserter."</p>

<p>The soldier, a man of the 57th, bound and helpless,
was then led up.</p>

<p>"You," he said, addressing the renegade, "are a
disgrace to your regiment and to your country. You
are said to have shot two of your own officers in
battle. You have helped these natives to commit
crimes which are a thousand times worse than open
war. You will kill no pakehas or natives after today."</p>

<p>With the instinct of a born leader, Ropata had
taken in the various points of the situation at a glance,
and issued his orders with the promptitude which
the crucial moment demanded.</p>

<p>"Release the pakehas. Kill that Hau-Hau dog
holding the rope, and hang up the deserter with it;
he is not worthy of a soldier's death. Bind that
Ngapuhi; he shall answer to his own chief."</p>

<p>These orders, coming from a man who rarely had
occasion to speak twice, were obeyed on the instant.
The amateur executioner was tomahawked before his
surprise permitted him to drop the rope. Cyril
Summers was freed, and the deserter was run up to
the branch of the willow tree destined for his martyrdom.
The cords which bound Erena and her attendants
were loosed by willing hands, the men and even the
women promptly possessing themselves of weapons
from their dead captors.</p>

<p>Ngarara's countenance, when he saw himself at once
baulked of his revenge and cheated of his prey, was
a study of all the evil passions which degrade the
human race to the level of the brute. Such is the
phrase, unfair indeed to the animal creation, which,
however unsparing in its allotted course of action, is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>

never guilty of the calculated cruelty of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la bête
humaine</i>. For one moment he stood indifferent to
his coming fate as Ropata himself; then, drawing his
revolver, fired point-blank at Massinger, who had raised
himself to a sitting posture with Erena's assistance, and
was watching the conflict with an eagerness which
betokened a partial renewal of strength. As he raised
the weapon Erena flung herself before her lover, with
an instinctive movement of protection. Passing her
right arm around his neck, she lowered him to his
pillow, with all the heroic tenderness which from time
immemorial has characterized the woman as nurse and
ministering angel. With a grin of fiendish malice
Ngarara parried the tomahawk blow aimed at him by
a blood-bespattered Aowera, and, eluding his clutch,
dashed into the forest and disappeared.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The fray was over. The Hau-Hau prisoners were
securely bound. Sullen and despairing, they stood
in a circle on the spot where their war-dance and the
Pai Marire rites had been performed. The derision
of their captors was openly expressed. The bodies
of their comrades and relations lay around in all the
hideous abandon of the death-agony. From the tall
pole the head of the ill-fated soldier still stared with
eyeless sockets and bared teeth on the ghastly scene&mdash;it
might have been fancied with grim triumph and
exultation; while from the willow tree dangled the
corpse of the deserter, an unconscious witness, where
he had so lately posed as an actor.</p>

<p>As if the dreadful spectacle had a fascination
which they could not resist, or that their miraculous
deliverance had rendered them incapable of connected

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>

thought, the destined victims had remained almost in
their positions taken up previous to the arrival of
Ropata and his contingent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Summers had sunk down on a sofa which
had been dislodged from its position, with her children,
wondering and tearful, beside her. The female attendants
of Erena were clustered around their mistress.
Cyril Summers, over whom the bitterness of death
had passed, stood by his wife, gazing with awe-struck
eyes into the distance, while his moving lips from
time to time gave token that he was returning thanks
to that Almighty Being to whom he had appealed
in his darkest hour. While Hypatia, wrapped in a
world of strange and awful phantasy, still stood by
the outer entrance of the porch, looking straight in
front of her, at this weird melodrama of human life,
in which the reality so often transcends the unrealities
of the "fantastic realm."</p>

<p>Erena and Roland Massinger had preserved their
position unaltered, except that, from one of support,
the girl gradually sank forward, until her head rested
on her lover's breast. A cry from one of the Maori
girls arrested the attention of all. Hypatia, roused
from her trance, rushed over to find two of them
raising Erena from her reclining position, with looks
of alarm, while the arterial blood which welled up
from her bosom told of a mortal wound. Massinger's
death-pale countenance, stained with blood, as were
the coverings of his couch, seemed to denote that
these lovers, thrown together by such fortuitous circumstances
in life, were fated to be undivided in death.</p>

<p>Though Massinger was unwounded by the bullet
which, aimed with fatal accuracy, had pierced the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>

bosom of Erena, his situation was most critical. For
her there was no hope. The lung had been perforated;
the laboured breathing showed but too truly that
death was imminent. In Massinger's case the appearances
were hardly more promising. The rude treatment
to which he had been subjected after his capture
had caused the partly healed wound to break out
afresh. He was rapidly approaching the state of
mortal weakness to which Erena was succumbing.
Such was only too probable; but Cyril Summers,
who had gone through a course of instruction in
surgery, was enabled to stop his bleeding, and to
afford temporary relief to Erena.</p>

<p>Massinger at first resented the proffered aid.
"Why trouble me?" he said resentfully. "She has
given her life to save mine; it were base of me to
survive her at such a cost. Let us die together. My life
belongs to her, who has now saved it for the third time."</p>

<p>"Then it is mine to dispose of," came the answer,
in her low rich tones. "I die happy, since you are
saved. If the bullet of Ngarara had found your
breast instead of mine, I would have followed you to
the spirit-land. You do not doubt that&mdash;oh, my
darling&mdash;my own beloved! The sun would not have
gone down before I should have commenced my
journey to the reinga."</p>

<p>"Erena," said Massinger, "have I ever doubted
your love, true alike in life and the dark realm, to
which we are hastening?"</p>

<p>"Raise me," she said, "that I may see his face
once more. My eyes are darkening. Oh, my beloved!"&mdash;and
her soft voice faltered, and became hollow and
inexpressibly mournful&mdash;"I have loved you with every

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>

fibre of my being, with every motion of my heart!
The pakeha girl loves you also, though she cared not
to own it, in her own land. She will live for you in
the days that are to come&mdash;days of peace and happiness,
now that the war is over. Would she die for
you as I have done? Yes; for she is noble, she is
true. She would have scorned to take your love from
poor Erena, even had you offered it. Her soul lay open
to me&mdash;and yours. You were true to your word. She
was too proud to steal your heart from the poor Maori
girl. And now, farewell&mdash;farewell for ever&mdash;oh, my
loved one! I die happy. I have given my life for yours&mdash;what
does a daughter of the Ngapuhi wish more?"</p>

<p>She leaned forward and hid her head on the
breast of her lover, while her long black tresses flowed
over his pillow, as her arms strained him to that
faithful bosom, still warm with the heart's purest feelings.
Reverently the little group of spectators gazed
on the dying girl. Sobs and lamentations came from
the women of her own race, while tears flowed fast
from the eyes of Mary Summers and Hypatia.</p>

<p>Raising herself for a moment, she motioned to
Hypatia to come nearer. Her dark eyes glowed with
transient light as she kissed her hand; then laying it
in that of Massinger, she whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is yours now. May all happiness befall you!
Yet forget not&mdash;oh! forget not&mdash;poor Erena."</p>

<p>A deep sigh followed the last words. Her head
fell back; the hand which Massinger and Hypatia
held was pulseless. The faithful spirit of the nymph
of the wood and stream, the fabled Oread of the old-world
poets, had passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The tragedy at Oropi, so nearly completed, might
have been averted, but for an unlucky accidental
circumstance, the occurrence of which embittered the
remainder of Allister Mannering's life. And yet he
could not wholly abandon himself to self-accusation
and ceaseless regrets, inasmuch as he had quitted
the trail on which, as the avenger of blood, he was
pursuing the Hau-Hau band, in order to save the
lives of innocent and helpless people.</p>

<p>He, indeed, with his contingent, would have
arrived at Oropi on the same day as Ropata, or,
perhaps, earlier. He would then have been able to
prevent the preliminary sufferings of the missionary
household, and could have ensured the safety of his
beloved daughter and only child. The cause of his
leaving the direct track to the mission station of Cyril
Summers was sufficiently imperative&mdash;such as, indeed,
no man of ordinary humanity could disregard.</p>

<p>A panting messenger, speeding along the track from
Whakatane, arrived with the news that another band
of Hau-Haus had killed the crew of the <i>Jane</i> schooner
at Opotiki, had murdered Mr. Fulloon, and captured
the Reverend Mr. Grace, whom there was every reason
to believe they intended to murder.</p>

<p>It was not known to Mannering at this time that
there was any likelihood of Kereopa's band being in
near proximity to Erena and her wounded charge.
By ordinary computation she should have reached
Tauranga several days before that bloodthirsty fanatic
could have overtaken her party. Cyril Summers and
his household, having been warned by the bishop, would
probably have moved into one of the coast settlements.</p>

<p>Thus one danger was contingent, the other was a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>

pressing and instant summons. Life and death were
in the decision. Murder and outrage, perhaps, even
now, had taken place. The full complement of horrors
could only be averted by a forced march and the
sudden appearance of his <i>hapu</i> upon the scene.
"Angel of God was there none" to whisper that
loved daughter's name, darling of his heart, apple of
his eye, that she was? Was there no mysterious spirit-warning
such as, if tales be true, has often, through
invisible sympathetic chords, eliminated time and
space? Did not the traditional second sight, inherited
from Highland ancestors, and of which he and Erena
claimed their portion, prove faithful in that dread
hour? Long afterwards&mdash;in years when he could talk
calmly of his loss, dwell upon her courage, her beauty,
and extol her intellectual range&mdash;he confessed to his
closest friend and comrade that he had felt, from the
time he turned aside to Opotiki, an overshadowing,
inexplicable gloom and despondency. He was convinced
in his own mind that (as he said) some dreadful
deed had taken place, or was even then about to
happen. Therefore he was hardly surprised, after
hours of feverishly fast travelling, to find Mr. Volkner's
mutilated corse beneath the willow tree which he had
himself planted. Mr. Grace, after being in hourly expectation
of a violent death, had been rescued by Captain
Levy, one of the survivors of the crew of the <i>Jane</i>,
and put on board H.M.S. <i>Eclipse</i>, Captain Fremantle.</p>

<p>Burning with wrath, and maddened with the doubt
as to whether Erena and Massinger might not even
yet be within the region traversed by the Hau-Hau
scouts, Mannering made a forced march, halting
neither by day nor night, rendered still more furious

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>

and despairing by the freshness of the trail, leading
straight for the Oropi mission station. Kereopa had
sworn, as rumour had it, that he would kill the third
Mikonaree pakeha and carry off his wife and children
as a prey, before proceeding to join the Kingites in
the sack and plunder of Auckland.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the mission was reached.
An unwonted stillness reigned; no dog barked, no
voice was heard from the native camp&mdash;an unusual
state of things within his experience, the wakeful
Maori being always ready for converse at any hour
of the night. The mission house itself was partially
closed only, but silent and deserted. The trim garden
was trampled over. The shrubs and fruit trees had
been broken down. The keen eyes of the Maoris
discerned a spot where the ground had been disturbed.
A short search exhumed more than one body, on
which bullet and tomahawk had written the history
of the engagement. The furniture in some rooms
was intact, in others recklessly broken up. A handkerchief,
a shoe, a neck-ribbon, told of recent occupation.
One article of female Maori headgear, a plume
of the beautiful <i>huia</i>, the distracted parent recognized
as an ornament of Erena's.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, like questing hounds, the Ngapuhi
warriors traversed the surrounding thickets with all the
keenness of a savage race. Imprints and signs, so faint
as to be almost invisible to the white man, told all too
plainly to them the history of the occupation of the
Hau-Haus, the arrival of Ropata and his men, the fight
(if such it could be called) and finally the departure of
the whole party, including the family, the victorious contingent,
and the prisoners, in full march for Tauranga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>Hoping against hope, yet with a cruel doubt
eating at his heart, Mannering sat with his head
between his hands for a stricken hour, before he
gave orders for his troop to be in readiness to march,
when the Southern Cross pointed towards dawn.
Long before the stars had paled, he strode fast and
eagerly at the head of his faithful band, on the well-marked
Tauranga track.</p>

<p>It was past midday when they arrived. The place
was astir, the streets were filled. There was murmur
of voices, and that indescribable feeling in the air
as of woe, or death imminent. Such was the conviction
which smote the strong soul of Allister Mannering
as, with his warriors ranked in battle line, he
joined the throng, evidently converging towards a
lofty cliff, which reared itself above the harbour.</p>

<p>An enclosure in which shrubs were in luxuriant
growth now came into view, and marble columns
showed themselves amid the dark green foliage. It
was the cemetery.</p>

<p>The truth flashed across him. He had been afraid
to ask. Was it, could it be, the funeral procession
of his darling daughter&mdash;of Erena, the bright, beautiful,
fearless maiden, whom he had so lately seen in the
pride of her stately maidenhood and joyous youth?
Lovely and beloved, was it possible that she could
be now, even now, before his haggard eyes, borne
to her tomb? He gazed on the little band of
mourning girls who carried the flower-decked coffin.
The native attendants of the missionary family walked
behind with Mrs. Summers and Hypatia, while Cyril
Summers, in full canonicals, with another clergyman,
the army chaplain, preceded the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind them, again, came a company of the 43rd
with their officers, another of the 68th, and the Forest
Rangers, with Von Tempsky at their head. Also
Messrs. Slyde and Warwick, who had been granted
special leave for that day only by the army surgeon,
looking weak and pale after their enforced seclusion.</p>

<p>Then came the native allies, the Arawa, the
Ngapuhi, the Ngatiporu, all stern and warlike of
appearance, proud to do honour to the maiden whose
mother was of their race, with the blood of chiefs in
her veins, whose descent could be traced back to the
migration from Hawaiki.</p>

<p>Those who knew of the love, so deep, so passionate,
which subsisted between the daughter and the sire,
could partly realize the dull despair, the agonizing
grief, which filled his heart at the moment. But none
of the ordinary signs of sorrow betrayed the storm of
anguish, the volcanic wrath and stifled fury, which
raged within. His stern countenance preserved a
rigid and awful calm. His voice faltered not as, walking
forward when the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i> halted, he respectfully
made request that the coffin-lid should be raised.</p>

<p>"Let me look upon the face once more," he said,
"even in death, that I shall never see again on earth."</p>

<p>His request was granted. He stooped, and raising
the cerecloth, gazed long and fixedly on the face of
the dead girl. Then moving forward, he signed to the
clergyman to proceed with the service, remaining
uncovered until the last sad words were, with deepest
feeling, solemnly pronounced.</p>

<p>As the irrevocable words were spoken, and the
clay-cold form, which had held the fiery yet tender
soul of Erena Mannering, was lowered into the grave,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>

a tempest of sobs, cries, and wailing lamentation,
until then repressed, burst forth from the Maoris in
the great gathering. Then Mannering slowly turned
away, and after dismissing his following, accompanied
Mr. Summers. From him he learned the full particulars
of the Hau-Hau invasion&mdash;of their captivity,
their fearful anticipation of death by torture, the
sudden appearance of Ropata and his warriors, their
miraculous escape, and the death of Erena in the very
moment of deliverance.</p>

<p>"She gave her life to save that of the man she
loved," said Mannering. "Her mother, long years
since, did the same in my case. She is her true
daughter. It was her fate, and could not be evaded.
She had the foreknowledge, of which she spoke to me
more than once."</p>

<p>Roland Massinger, on the way to recovery, but too
weak for independent action, still lay in the military
hospital.</p>

<p>Mannering, as he stood beside his couch, and gazed
on his wasted features, looked, with his vast form and
foreign air, like some fabled genie of the Arabian tale.</p>

<p>"She is gone," said the sick man, as he raised himself
and held out the trembling fingers, which feebly
grasped the iron hand of his visitor&mdash;"she is gone; she
died in shielding me. I feel ashamed to be alive. I
cannot ask your pardon. I was the cause of her death."</p>

<p>The rigid features of the father relaxed, as he
watched the grief-worn countenance of the younger
man, and noted the sincerity and depth of his despairing
words.</p>

<p>"My boy," he said, "you have played your part
nobly, as did she; and you have, by a hair's breadth,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>

escaped being buried beside her this day. She died
for the man she loved, as only a daughter of her race
can love. There must be no feeling but affection and
respect between us. I mourned her mother as do you
her daughter. Poor darling Erena! Oh, my child&mdash;my
child!"</p>

<p>Mannering's freedom from ordinary human weakness
deserted him here. He threw himself on his
knees by the side of Massinger's bed, who then
witnessed a sight unseen before by living eyes&mdash;the
strong man's tears as he abandoned himself to unrestrained
grief. Sobs and muffled cries, groans and
lamentations of terrible intensity, shook his powerful
frame. Weakened by his wound, and compelled to
thus relieve his intolerable anguish, Roland Massinger's
tears flowed fast in unison, as for a brief interval they
mingled their sorrow. Then raising himself, and regaining
the impassive expression which his features, save in
familiar converse, ordinarily wore, the war-chief of the
Ngapuhi bade adieu to the man whom he had looked
forward to acknowledging with pride as the husband
of the darling of his heart, the idol of his latter years.</p>

<p>"Fate has willed it otherwise," he said. "You
may have happy years before you in your own land,
with perhaps a wife and children to perpetuate your
name and inherit your lands. I wish you such happiness
as I know <em>she</em> would have done. Her generous
heart would so will it, if she could speak its promptings
from 'the undiscovered country.' In her name,
and with her authority, knowing her inmost thoughts,
I say&mdash;May God bless you and prosper you in the
future path! In this life we shall meet no more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Kereopa and Ngarara had escaped; but Ropata,
who had started as soon as he delivered up his Hau-Hau
prisoners, was hot on their trail. Kereopa, in
spite of his keen and eager pursuit, fled to the Uriwera
country, where he found shelter for a time, but led the
hunted life of the outcast until it suited his protectors
to betray him. Forwarded to Auckland, he was duly
tried, convicted, and hanged.</p>

<p>Ngarara had a shorter term of comparative freedom.
One morning, shortly after the attack on the mission,
a small party of the Aowera appeared at Whakarewarewa,
the main body of the tribe being encamped
on Lake Rotorua. A bound prisoner was in their
midst, on whose movements they kept watchful guard.
It was Ngarara! A sub-chief, having been apprised
of the capture, arrived with leading warriors. One
glance at his stern features assured the captive that
he had no mercy to expect. Contrary to Maori usage,
he did not disdain to beg for it.</p>

<p>"I tried to kill the pakeha," he said. "What
harm was there in that? He stole the heart of the
girl I loved; who, but for him and his cunning ways,
might have loved me. I would have given my life for
her. Other men have killed pakehas&mdash;Rewi, Rawiri,
even Te Oriori; why should I be the sacrifice?"</p>

<p>The chief listened with an air of disgust, but did
not deign to reply. Meanwhile an order had been
given, and the party marched on, taking the prisoner
with them, preserving a strict silence, which evidently
impressed him more deeply than any other treatment.
In about three hours they arrived at the mission
station of Ngae. Here a feeling of misgiving appeared
to arise in the captive's mind, and he muttered the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>

word "Tikitere" with an accent of inquiry. But no
man answered or took notice of his speech.</p>

<p>But when they reached that desolate and awful
valley, and saw the mud volcanoes and steaming springs
in furious motion, his courage failed him. He saw the
hissing, bubbling lakes separated by a narrow ridge,
aptly named the Gate of Hell, standing on which
the traveller shudders, while breathing sulphuretted
hydrogen and beholding the turbid waves on either
side&mdash;the while the tremulous soil suggests the
enormous power of the central fires, which at any time
might rend and ruin all around with earthquake shock
and suddenness.</p>

<p>He knew also, none better, of the dread blackness
of the inferno, in which the sombre billows of a tormented
sea of boiling mud are heaving and seething
continually.</p>

<p>As with careful steps his guards half dragged, half
carried him across the treacherous flat, seamed with
fissures, where death lay in wait for the heedless
stranger, he appeared to comprehend fully the fate
that awaited him. He yelled aloud and struggled so
wildly, even despite his bonds, that, at a motion of
Ropata's arm, two stalwart natives stepped forward to
the aid of their comrades as he neared the fatal abyss.</p>

<p>"Dog of a murderer, coward and slave besides," said
the chief, as, halting on the brink, the guards awaited
his signal&mdash;"a disgrace to the tribe which never was
known to flee! Did Erena show fear when the bullet
pierced her breast? Did the pakeha soldier shriek like
the night owl when thy traitor's bullet struck his back&mdash;his
back, I say, and he with thee in the same battle
against the Ngaiterangi at Peke-hina? Did the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>

pakeha girl, the white Rangatira, or the Mikonaree cry
for mercy when Kereopa was ready to commence the
torture? It is not fitting for thee to die the death of
a warrior or a soldier. A coward's death, a slave's, a
cur's, is thy only fitting end. Such, and no other, shalt
thou have." He motioned with his hand.</p>

<p>A yell which made the deeps and hollows resound
came from the unhappy wretch, as his captors lifted
him on high and raised him for a moment above the
Dantean abyss. As the miserable traitor fell from
their grasp, he seized in his teeth the mat (<i>purere</i>)
of the nearest man, who, but for the prompt action
of his comrade, might have been dragged with him
into the inferno. But that wary warrior, with lightning
quickness, struck such a blow on the nape of
his neck with the back of the tomahawk hanging to
his wrist with a leather thong, that he fell forward,
nerveless and quivering, into the hell cauldron
beneath. For one moment he emerged, with a face
expressive of unutterable anguish, madness, and
despair, then raising his fettered arms to the level of
his head, fell backward into the depths of the raging
and impure weaves.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>"<i>Tutua-kuri-mokai!</i>" said the chief, as he gave
the signal for return, and sauntered carelessly homeward.
"He will cost nothing for burial. There are
others that are fitting themselves for the same place."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Cyril Summers with his family returned to England,
rightly judging that, in the present state of Maori
feeling, it was unfair to expose his wife to the risk of
a repetition of the horrors from which they had escaped.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>

Hypatia accompanied them, unwilling to forsake her
friend, whose state of health, weakened by their terrible
experiences, rendered her companionship indispensable.
On reaching England the Reverend Cyril was offered
an incumbency in the diocese of his beloved bishop,
now of Lichfield, in the peaceful performance of the
duties of which he has found rest for his troubled
spirit. His wife's health was completely re-established.
Without in any way derogating from the importance
of his work among the heathen, which, after having
reached so encouraging a stage, had been ruthlessly
arrested, he arrived at the conclusion that he had a
worthy and hardly less difficult task to perform in
the conversion of the heathen in the Black Country.
His bishop acknowledged privately with regret that
their savages, though not less truculent, were devoid of
many of the redeeming qualities of the Maori heathen.</p>

<p>Roland Massinger remained in New Zealand until
his health was thoroughly re-established, when, having
received the welcome intelligence that Mr. Hamon de
Massinger, an old bachelor and a distant relation, had
left him a very large fortune, he so far modified his
thirst for adventure and heroic colonization as to take
his passage to England, where his lawyers advised
that his presence was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival, he lost no time in visiting his
county and looking up his friends, who made a
tremendous hero of him, and would by no means
allow him to deny astonishing feats of valour performed
during the Maori war. He also discovered
that his Australian successor, though most popular
in the county, had become tired of the unrelieved
comfort and too pronounced absence of adventure

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>

in English country life. The sport, the society, the
farming even, so restricted as to be minute in his eyes,
all had become uninteresting to the ex-pioneer, not
yet old enough to fall out of the ranks of England's
empire-makers. These considerations, coupled with
a fall in wool, and the rumour of a drought, widespread
and unprecedented in severity, decided Mr.
Lexington to return to the land of his birth.</p>

<p>His elder daughter had married satisfactorily, and
settled in the county. "She had," she averred, "no
ultra-patriotic longings. England, with an annual trip
to the Continent, was good enough for her. She doubted
whether George would care for Australia. Then there
was the dear baby, who was too young to travel. She
was truly sorry to part from her family, but as the
voyage was now only a matter of five weeks by the
P. and O. or the Messageries boats, she could come
out and see them every other year, at any rate."</p>

<p>As for the younger girl, she began to pine for the
plains and forests amid which her childhood had been
passed. England was a sort of fairyland, no doubt.
Climate lovely and cool, and the people kind and
charming; but somehow the old country&mdash;that is, the
new country&mdash;where they had been born and bred,
seemed to have prior claims. She would not be sorry
to see the South Head Lighthouse again and Sydney
Harbour.</p>

<p>The eldest son had gone more than a year ago.
He was very glad, he wrote, that he had done
so. One manager had become extravagant; another
had taken to drinking. Everybody seemed to think
that they (the family) had left Australia for good.
There was such a thing as the master's eye, without

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>

doubt. Such had been his experience. He would
tell them more when he saw them.</p>

<p>One of the reasons which actuated Mr. Lexington,
a shrewd though liberal man in business matters, was
a dislike to paying the income-tax in two countries at
the same time. He could afford it, certainly, but it
struck him as wasteful, and in a measure unfair, to
make an Australian pay extravagantly for desiring to
live in the mother-land. Then, after assisting to enlarge
the empire abroad, the price of landed estates in
England had gone down seriously&mdash;was, indeed, going
down still. With a probability of a serious fall in values
in both hemispheres, it was better to part with his English
investment while he could get a purchaser for it, who,
like himself, was not disposed to stand upon trifles.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that, after a conference between
his own and the Massinger solicitors, Mr. Lexington
accepted the proposal to sell Massinger Court, with
the Hereford herd of high-bred cattle, hacks, hunters,
carriage-horses, vehicles, saddlery&mdash;indeed, everything
just as it stood. All these adjuncts to be taken at a
valuation, and added to the price of the estate, the
re-purchase of which by a member of the family was
what most probably, though his solicitor declined to
say, old Mr. Hamon de Massinger, the testator, had
in view all along.</p>

<p>The county was ridiculously overjoyed, as some
acidulated person said, that the rightful heir, so to
speak, was come to his own again. Independently
of such feeling, nowhere stronger than in English
county society, few localities but would feel a certain
satisfaction at the return of a county magnate&mdash;rich,
unmarried, and distinguished, as a man must always

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>

be who has fought England's battles abroad, and shed
his blood in upholding her honour. Thus, although
the free-handed and unaffected Australian family was
heartily regretted, and "farewelled" with suitable
honours, the sentimental corner in all hearts responded
fervently to the news that the young squire had
returned to the home of his ancestors, and would
henceforth, as he declared at the tenants' enthusiastically
joyous reception, live among his own people.</p>

<p>Of course, all sorts of exaggerated versions of his
life in the far South prevailed. These comprised
prowess in war, hairbreadth escapes, wounds, and
captivity, the whole rounded off with a legend of
a beautiful native princess, who had brought him as
her dower a principality beneath the Southern Cross.
To these romantic rumours he paid no attention
whatever, refusing to be drawn, and giving the most
cursory answers to direct questions. But when, after
spending a quiet year on his estate, in the management
of which he took great interest, it was announced
that he was about to be married to the beautiful,
distinguished, fascinating, eccentric Hypatia Tollemache,
all the county was wildly excited. When the
event took place, the particulars of the quiet wedding
were read and re-read by every one in his own and
the adjacent counties.</p>

<p>Fresh tales and legends, however, continued to
be circulated. His first wife&mdash;for he had married
a beautiful Maori princess; at any rate, a chief's
daughter&mdash;was killed fighting by his side in a tribal
war. She was jealous of Miss Tollemache, and
had committed suicide. Not at all. Her father,
a great war-chief, disapproved of the union, and,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>

carrying her off, had immured her in his stronghold,
surrounded by a lake, which her despairing husband
could not cross. So she pined away and died. <em>That</em>
was the reason for his occasional fits of depression,
and his insensibility to the charms of the local belles.</p>

<p>He was obdurate with respect to giving information
as to the truth or otherwise of these interesting
narratives; indeed, so obviously unwilling to gratify
even the most natural curiosity, that at length even the
most hardened inquisitor gave up the task in despair.</p>

<p>The county had more reason for complaint when
it was further announced that Sir Roland and his
bride had left for the Continent immediately after the
wedding, whence they did not propose returning until
the near approach of Christmas-tide. Then such old-world
festivities as were still remembered by the
villagers in connection with former lords of the manor
would be conscientiously kept up, while the largesse
to the poor, which under the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> had not by
any means fallen into disuse, would be disbursed with
exceptional profusion.</p>

<p>After the sale Mr. Lexington had been besought
to consult his own convenience, absolutely and unreservedly,
as to the time and manner of his departure.
The purchase-money having been received, and all
legal forms completed, he was to consider the house
and all things appertaining thereto at his service.
Messrs. Nourse and Lympett had instructions to take
delivery of the estate whenever it suited him to vacate
it. The Australian gentleman, having had much experience
in the sale and taking over of "stations" in
Australia&mdash;always regarded as a crucial test of liberality&mdash;was
heard to declare that never in his life had he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>

purchased and resold so extensive a property with so
little trouble, or concluded so considerable a transaction
with less friction or misunderstanding on either side.</p>

<p>And so, when the leaves in the woods around the
Chase had fallen, and the ancient oaks and elms were
arrayed in all their frost and snow jewellery, word
came that the squire with his bride were returning
from their extended tour. They would arrive on a
certain day, prepared to inhabit the old hall which
had sheltered in pride and power so many generations
of the race. Then the whole county went off its head,
and prepared for his home-coming. Such a demonstration
had not been heard of since Sir Hugo de
Massinger, constable of Chester, came home from the
wars in Wales after the death of Gwenwyn.</p>

<p>When the train drew up to the platform, such
a crowd was there that Hypatia looked forth with
amazement, wondering whether there was a contested
election, with the chairing of the successful candidate
imminent. Every man of note in the county was
there, from the Duke of Dunstanburgh to the last
created knight. Every tenant, every villager, with
their wives and daughters, sons and visitors; every
tradesman&mdash;in fact, every soul within walking, riding,
or driving distance&mdash;had turned up to do honour to
Sir Roland of the Court, who, after adventures by sea
and land, through war and bloodshed, had been
suffered, doubtless by the direct interposition of
Providence, to come to his own again.</p>

<p>As Sir Roland and his fair dame passed through
the crowd towards their chariot, it was quickly understood
what was to be the order of the day. The
horses were taken out, and a dozen willing hands

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>

grasped the pole, preparatory to setting forth for the
Court, some three miles distant. Waving his hand
to request silence, the bridegroom said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord duke, ladies and gentlemen, and you
my good friends, who have known me from childhood,
I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the
welcome which you have given to me and my dear
wife on our return to our native country and the home
of my ancestors. My wife would thank you on her
part, if her heart was not too full. We trust that in
the future we may show by our lives, lived among
you, how deeply, how intensely, we appreciate your
generous welcome. At present I can say nothing
more, than to invite you, one and all, to accompany
us to the Court, to do us the honour to accept the
first hospitality we have been in a position to offer
since I left England."</p>

<p>Due notice had been given. Preparations had
been made on a scale of unprecedented magnitude.
A partial surprise awaited the wedded pair as the
carriage passed through the massive gates, above
which the triumphal arch seemed to have levied contributions
on half the evergreens in the park. The
heraldic beasts, each "a demi-Pegasus quarterly or in
gules," on the moss-grown pillars, were garlanded
with hot-house flowers, as also with the holly-bush and
berries appropriate to the season. Marquees had
been erected on the lawns, where all manner of meats,
from the lordly baron of beef to the humbler flitch of
bacon, were exhibited in such profusion as might lead
to the inference that a regiment had been billeted on
the village. It would not have been for the first time.
Cromwell's Ironsides <em>had</em>, indeed, tried demi-saker,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>

arblast, and culverin on the massive walls of the old
hall, without, however, much decisive effect. Hogsheads
of ale were there more than sufficient to wash down
the solid fare, for which the keen bright atmosphere
furnished suitable appetites.</p>

<p>The nobility and gentry were entertained in the
great dining-hall, where a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> had been prepared,
thoroughly up to date, abounding in all modern
requirements. Champagne and claret flowed in
perennial abundance. The plate, both silver and
gold, heirlooms of the ancient house, had been brought
back from their resting-places. It was evident that
the whole thing&mdash;the cuisinerie, the decorations, the
waiters, the fruit, and flowers&mdash;had been sent down
from London days before; and as Sir Roland and
Hypatia took their places at the head of the table,
mirth and joyous converse commenced to ripple and
flow ceaselessly. Even the ancestral portraits seemed to
have acquired a glow of gratification as the lovely and
the brave, the gallant courtiers or the grim warriors,
looked down upon their descendant and his bride; on
those fortunate ones so lately restored to the pride and
power of their position&mdash;so lately in peril of losing these
historic possessions, and their lives at the same time.</p>

<p>Did Hypatia, as an expression of thoughtful retrospection
shaded her countenance momentarily, recall
another scene, scarcely two years since, when the
bridegroom, now rejoicing in the pride of manhood, lay
wounded, and a captive, helplessly awaiting an agonizing
death; herself in the power of maddened savages,
as was Cyril Summers with his wife and children?
Then the miraculous interposition&mdash;the fierce Ropata
sweeping away the rebel fanatics, with the fire of his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>

wrath! And she&mdash;alas! the faithful, the devoted
Erena, but for whose sacrificial tenderness Sir Roland
would not have been by her side today! What was
she, Hypatia, more than others, that such things should
have been done for her? The tears <em>would</em> rise to her
eyes, in spite of her efforts to compose her countenance,
as she looked on the joyous faces around. Mary
Summers and her husband sat in calm enjoyment of
the scene. Then, with a heartfelt inward prayer to
Him who had so disposed their fortunes to this happy
ending, she strove to mould her feelings to a mood
more in accordance with her present surroundings.</p>

<p>A change in the proceedings was at hand. The
Duke of Dunstanburgh, rising, besought his good
friends and neighbours to charge their glasses, and
to bear with him for a few moments, while he proposed
a toast which doubtless they had all anticipated.</p>

<p>His young friend, as he was proud to call him,
whose father he had known and loved, had this day
been restored to the seat of his ancestors, to the
ancient home of the De Massingers in their county.
He would but touch lightly on his adventures, by
flood and field, in that far land, to which he had
elected to find&mdash;er&mdash;an&mdash;outlet for his energy.
Danger had there been, as they all knew. Blood
had been shed. The lives of himself and his lovely
bride, who now shed lustre upon their gathering,
had trembled in the balance, when by an almost
miraculous interposition succour arrived. He would
not pursue the subject, with which painful memories
were interwoven. Enough to state that under all
circumstances, even the most desperate, Sir Roland
had maintained the honour of England, and had shed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>

his blood freely in defence of her time-honoured institutions.
(Tremendous cheering.) He had returned,
thank God! he would say in all sincerity, and was
now, with his bride, a lady who in all respects would
do honour to the county and the kingdom, placed in
possession of the hall of his ancestors. He was come&mdash;they
had his assurance&mdash;prepared to live and die
among them; among the friends of his youth, and
those older neighbours who, like the speaker, had
hunted and fished and shot with his father before
him. He was proud this day to give them the
toast of Sir Roland and Lady de Massinger&mdash;to
wish them long life and prosperity&mdash;and he was sure
he might add, in the name of the whole county, to
welcome them most heartily to their home.</p>

<p>When the cheering had subsided, taken up again
and again, as it was from the outer hall and even
from the lawn, by the tenants and villagers, who, if they
could not see, could at least judge by the storm of
voices as to the nature of the address which had called
it forth, Sir Roland stood up and faced the crowd of
guests, who cheered again and again as though they
never intended to stop. He commenced with studied
calmness, thanking them all, his good friends and
neighbours, the old friends of the house, and those
among whom he had lived so long in friendship, he
might say affectionate intimacy, until circumstances,
apparently, made it necessary for him to leave the
home of his childhood. They would doubtless appreciate
the greatness of the sacrifice, the bitterness of
feeling, with which he quitted the home of his race.
He resolved to go as far as was possible from home
and its memories, and had, in fact, gone so far South

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>

that the Pole only would have been the next abiding-place.
It was a British outpost, however, well
deserving the name of the Britain of the South;
destined in years to come to be the home, the
prosperous home, of millions of the men of our race,
and one of the brightest jewels in the Imperial crown.
Difficulties had arisen with the Maori nation, a proud,
a brave, a highly intelligent people, who had made
the best defence in war against British regulars by
an aboriginal race since the days when the stubborn
valour of the ancient Britons scarce yielded to
the legionaries of Rome. (Tremendous cheering.)
That war, fraught with disastrous losses in men and
officers to Britain's bravest regiments, was now over,
he was rejoiced to say. There might be irregular
fighting from time to time, but the high chiefs had
surrendered, and vast areas of the most fertile land
in the world had now become the property of the
Crown. He himself held what might be considered
an incredibly large domain, which must prove of
great value in time to come. He would not mention
the number of acres. He was <em>not</em> going back there.
(Redoubled cheering.) He could assure them of that
fact, though in days to come another Massinger
Court might arise beneath the Southern Cross.
(Renewed cheering.) He was as fixed here, under
Providence (he told them now), as the "King's Oak"
in the Chase. (Loud and prolonged cheering.) He
and his wife had experienced a sufficiency of adventure,
by land and sea, to last them for their natural
lives. They desired, in all humility, to return heartfelt
thanks to Almighty God for their restoration to this
pleasant home, and those dear friends whom at one

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>

time they never thought to see again. They hoped
to prove their gratitude, by lives of usefulness in
their day and generation.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The adventures of Sir Roland de Massinger and
Hypatia his wife, insomuch as regards peril and
uncertainty of war or peace, travel by land and sea,
or even the stormy politics of a new nation, must be
said now to have lost much of their interest. Henceforth
Sir Roland was contented to pursue the ordinary
course of the country gentleman of England, which,
if not exciting or adventurous, is surely one of the
happiest lives in the world. He was contented to
manage his New Zealand property through an agent.
Indeed, after Mr. Slyde's appearance in England&mdash;that
gentleman having received a year's leave of absence,
on account of his wound and eminent services in the
war&mdash;he was pleased to place the whole management
of Waikato Court and Chase, near the flourishing
township of Chesterfield, in his hands. Mr. Slyde
was about to relinquish his connection with the New
Zealand Land Company, having, as he said with his
customary cynicism, been fool enough to encumber
himself with a picturesque and fertile block of land,
on the same river, and also to commit the crowning
folly of matrimony with a young lady to whom he
had become engaged just after the war. New Zealand
was bad enough, he averred, but for a man who had
been born without the proverbial silver spoon, England
was the worst country in the civilized world. Therefore,
if his comrade, Sir Roland, had sufficient faith
in his intelligence and honesty&mdash;rather rare endowments
in a colony&mdash;he supposed he could manage

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>

both properties with much the same outlay of cash
and industry as his own.</p>

<p>The arrangement was completed, and worked so
satisfactorily, that for many a year Sir Roland had
no duties connected with the antipodean estates
beyond supervising the sale of wool, frozen mutton,
butter, cheese, cocksfoot grass seed, and other annual
products, which so excited the admiration of his
neighbours and tenants that they could hardly be
made to believe that such satisfactory samples could
be produced out of England, his frozen lamb, equal
to "prime Canterbury," notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Hypatia is truly happy in her home&mdash;blessed with
a growing family, contented with her duties as the
wife of a county member, and, above all, firmly
convinced that Roland was the only man she had
ever loved. She is almost convinced, as her outspoken
friend Mrs. Merivale (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Branksome) often
assured her, that it served her right for her absurdly
altruistic notions and general perversity that she so
nearly lost him. The days are only too short for her
employments and enjoyments. Nor did she abandon
the philanthropical obligation, but as the kindly,
generous, and capable Lady Bountiful of the estate,
is "earthlier happy as the rose distilled" than in any
imaginable state of "single blessedness," however
advanced and politically eminent.</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"A quiet country book in the main, with more
emotion than action, and continuous interest."</p>

<p><i>DAILY MAIL.</i>&mdash;"One of the sweetest and most satisfying love
stories that we have read for many weeks past. To read <cite>Off the High
Road</cite> is as mentally bracing as an actual holiday among the rural delights
of the farm, the orchard, and the spinney, in which the scenes of the
novel are so refreshingly set."</p>

<p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"Is the story of a summer in the life of a high-spirited
and very charming heiress.... The book has a fresh open-air
atmosphere that is decidedly restful."</p>

<p><i>BLACK AND WHITE.</i>&mdash;"An admirable specimen of the genus
'light story.' Miss Eleanor C. Price tells her story with a gay good
humour which is infectious. We are not asked to think, only to allow
ourselves to be interested and amused.... We feel grateful to
Miss Price for her bright well-written book. The girl of the mysterious
advertisement is a charming character."</p>

<p><i>MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"A decidedly attractive little book,
with a pleasing atmosphere of green fields, orchards, and wild-rose
hedges."</p>

<p><i>ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"This new batch of Mr. Kipling's short
stories is splendid work. Among the thirteen there are included at least
five of his very finest.... Speaking for ourselves, we have read <cite>The
Day's Work</cite> with more pleasure than we have derived from anything of
Mr. Kipling's since the <cite>Jungle Book</cite>.... It is in the Findlaysons, and
the Scotts, and the Cottars, and the 'Williams,' that Mr. Kipling's true
greatness lies. These are creations that make one feel pleased and
proud that we are also English. What greater honour could there be
to an English writer?"</p>

high reputation both on land and by sea."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"If <cite>The Day's Work</cite> will not add to the author's
reputation in this kind of work, which, indeed, might be difficult,
it at all events will not detract from it. There is no lack of spirit
and power; the same easy mastery of technical details; the same broad
sympathy with the English-speaking race, wherever their life-tasks
may lie. The style is throughout Kipling's own&mdash;terse, nervous, often
rugged, always direct and workmanlike, the true reflection of Mr.
Kipling's own genius."</p>

<p><i>MORNING POST.</i>&mdash;"The book is so varied, so full of colour and
life from end to end, that few who read the first two or three stories
will lay it down till they have read the last."</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"There are the same masterful grip
and wielding of words that are almost surprised to find themselves
meaning so much; the same buoyant joy in men who 'do' things."</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"With sure instinct he labels the volume <cite>The Day's
Work</cite>. That is just what these tales are&mdash;the day's work of a great
imaginative and observant writer, of a master craftsman who, when he
has no <i>magnum opus</i> on hand, rummages in drawers, peers into cupboards,
for notions noted and not forgotten, for beginnings laid aside to
be finished in their proper season."</p>

<p><i>SCOTSMAN.</i>&mdash;"A fine book, one that even a dull man will rejoice
to read."</p>

<p>A romantic story of Moorish life in the Rift Country and in Tangier

received in the beginning of the year, and whose West African and
Australian Bush stories will be familiar to most readers of fiction.

his limpidity and minuteness of touch, his keenness of observation.... The
book abounds in clever character sketches.... It is very
good."</p>

<p><i>ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;There is something peculiarly fascinating
in Mr. Maarten Maartens's new story. It is one of those
exquisitely told tales, not unhappy, nor tragic, yet not exactly 'happy,'
but full of the pain&mdash;as a philosopher has put it&mdash;that one prefers, which
are read, when the reader is in the right mood, with, at least, a subdued

novelist of whom we know, not even Felix Gras, has so vividly brought
before us the life of lower Paris in the awful days of the Terror. A
dozen or so admirable reproductions of the drawings specially made by
A. Castaigne for 'François,' during its serial appearance, add attraction
to a romance as notable as it is delightful."</p>

<p><i>MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"The author meets with a master's
ease every call that is made upon his resources, and the calls are neither
few nor light. The design, bold though it is, lies so well within his
compass as to suggest a reserve of strength rather than limitations. And
a style that is versatile but always distinguished, delicate but always
virile, terse but never obscure, is in a strong hand an instrument for
strong work. The pictures by A. Castaigne are worthy of the text."</p>

which eventually develops into a garden occupies the foreground,
there is still room for much else&mdash;for children, husbands, guests,
gardeners, and governesses, all of which are treated in a very entertaining
manner."</p>

<p><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;"A very bright little book&mdash;genial, humorous, perhaps a
little fantastic and wayward here and there, but full of bright glimpses
of nature and sprightly criticisms of life. Elizabeth is the English
wife of a German husband, who finds and makes for herself a delightful
retreat from the banalities of life in a German provincial town by
occupying and beautifying a deserted convent."</p>

<p><i>SCOTSMAN.</i>&mdash;"The garden in question is somewhere in Germany.... Its
owner found it a wilderness, has made it a paradise, and tells
the reader how. The book is charmingly written.... The people that
appear in it are almost as interesting as the flowers.... Altogether it
is a delightful book, of a quiet but strong interest, which no one who
loves plants and flowers ought to miss reading."</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"'I love my garden'&mdash;that is the first sentence, and
reading on, we find ourselves in the presence of a whimsical, humorous,
cultured, and very womanly woman, with a pleasant, old-fashioned
liking for homeliness and simplicity; with a wise husband, three merry
babes, aged five, four, and three, a few friends, a gardener, an old
German house to repose in, a garden to be happy in, an agreeable
literary gift, and a slight touch of cynicism. Such is Elizabeth. The
book is a quiet record of her life in her old world retreat, her adventures
among bulbs and seeds, the sayings of her babies, and the
discomfiture and rout of a New Woman visitor.... It is a charming
book, and we should like to dally with it."</p>

<p><i>GLASGOW HERALD.</i>&mdash;"This book has to do with more than a
German garden, for the imaginary diary which it contains is really a
description, and a very charming and picturesque one, of life in a north

where anything approaching sentimentality or sermonizing does not meet
with much appreciation."</p>

the telling of the story which is refreshing."</p>

<p><i>SATURDAY REVIEW.</i>&mdash;"It has all her tenderness and homely
humour, and in the case of all three stories there is a good idea well
worked out."</p>

<p><i>LITERATURE.</i>&mdash;"To come across a work of Mrs. Oliphant's is to
come across a pleasant, little green oasis in the arid desert of minor
novels.... In these the author's refinement, tenderness, and charm of
manner are as well exemplified as in any of her earlier works.... The
book is one that we can most cordially recommend."</p>

<p><i>DAILY NEWS.</i>&mdash;"Each story that comes to us from the hand of
Mrs. Oliphant moves us to admiration for its delicate craftsmanship, the
keen appreciation it displays of the resources of situation and character.
The posthumous volume, 'That Little Cutty, and other Stories,' is an
excellent example of Mrs. Oliphant's power of telling a story swiftly
and with dramatic insight. Every touch tells.... The little volume is
worthy of its author's high and well-deserved reputation."</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"All three are admirably written in that
easy, simple narrative style to which the author had so thoroughly
accustomed us. It will be for many of Mrs. Oliphant's friends a wholly
unexpected pleasure to have a new volume of fiction with her name on
the title-page."</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"They are models of what such stories
should be."</p>

<p><i>SHEFFIELD DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"Excellent examples of
Mrs. Oliphant's work."</p>

<p><i>SCOTSMAN.</i>&mdash;"All three stories have a fine literary flavour and an
artistic finish, and within their limited scope present some subtle
analyses of character."</p>

<p><i>NORTHERN WHIG.</i>&mdash;"Anything from the pen of the late
Mrs. Oliphant will always be welcome to a large number of readers,
who will therefore note with pleasant interest the publication by
Messrs. Macmillan of a neat volume containing three tales, 'That
Little Cutty,' 'Dr. Barrère,' and 'Isabel Dysart.' Of the three,
although all are most readable, the most skilfully constructed is the
second named, the plot and climax of which are decidedly dramatic.
The last story deals with the still unforgotten period of the horrible
Burke and Hare revelations in Edinburgh."</p>

<div class="blockad">

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"<cite>The Forest Lovers</cite> is no mere literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i>,
but an uncommonly attractive romance, the charm of which is greatly
enhanced by the author's excellent style."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Maurice Hewlett's <cite>Forest Lovers</cite>
stands out with conspicuous success.... He has compassed a very
remarkable achievement.... For nearly four hundred pages he carries
us along with him with unfailing resource and artistic skill, while he
unrolls for us the course of thrilling adventures, ending, after many
tribulations, in that ideal happiness towards which every romancer
ought to wend his tortuous way.... There are few books of this
season which achieve their aim so simply and whole-heartedly as
Mr. Hewlett's ingenious and enthralling romance."</p>

<p><i>WORLD.</i>&mdash;"If there are any romance-lovers left in this matter-of-fact
end of the century, <cite>The Forest Lovers</cite>, by Mr. Maurice Hewlett,
should receive a cordial welcome. It is one of those charming books
which, instead of analyzing the morbid emotions of which we are all
too weary, opens a door out of this workaday world and lets us escape
into fresh air. A very fresh and breezy air it is which blows in
Mr. Hewlett's forest, and vigorous are the deeds enacted there.... There
is throughout the book that deeper and less easily defined charm
which lifts true romance above mere story-telling&mdash;a genuine touch of
poetic feeling which beautifies the whole."</p>

<p><i>DAILY MAIL.</i>&mdash;"It is all very quaintly and pleasingly done, with
plenty of mad work, and blood-spilling, and surprising adventure."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Lane Allen</span>, Author of <cite>The Choir Invisible</cite>, writes of
<cite>The Forest Lovers</cite>: "This work, for any one of several solid reasons,
must be regarded as of very unusual interest. In the matter of style
alone, it is an achievement, an extraordinary achievement. Such a
piece of English prose, saturated and racy with idiom, compact and
warm throughout as living human tissues, well deserves to be set apart
for grateful study and express appreciation.... In the matter of
interpreting nature there are passages in this book that I have never
seen surpassed in prose fiction."</p>

furnished with clever phrases."</p>

<p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"The novel is well written, and full of complex
interests and personalities. It touches on many questions and problems
clearly and skilfully."</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"A book which entirely interested us for
the whole of a blazing afternoon. He writes uncommonly well."</p>

<p><i>BOOKMAN.</i>&mdash;"The excellence of Mr. Herrick's book lies not in the
solution of any problem, nor in the promulgation of any theory, nor
indeed in any form of docketing and setting apart of would-be final
answers to the enigmas of existence. He simply tells a story and leaves
us to draw what conclusion we like. The admirable thing is that his
story is a particularly interesting one, and that he tells it remarkably
well.... There are some delightful minor characters."</p>

<p><i>MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"The characters, all American,
have originality and life. The self-engrossed Adela is so cleverly drawn
that we are hardly ever out of sympathy with her aspirations, and
Molly Parker, the 'womanly' foil, is delightful."</p>

<div class="blockad">

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"Remarkable for the fulness of its
author's knowledge.... Nor does the interest of Mr. Hamblen's
volume depend solely on its vivid account of sensational escapes and
dramatic accidents, though there is no lack of exciting incidents of this
kind in his story.... What charmed us chiefly in the story was the close
and exact account of the everyday working of a great railroad.... There
was not a page that we did not find full of interest and instruction.
It was all real, and most of it new, while Mr. Hamblen's vivid and
straightforward style does much to enhance the intrinsic merits of his
narrative.... We venture to think that no one will be able to leave
the breathless and realistic account of such an episode as the chase of
the runaway engine&mdash;not a figment of the imagination, but a sober and
hideous fact, accounted for and explained by the most intelligible of
mechanical reasons&mdash;without a thrill of genuine excitement."</p>

<p><i>SCOTSMAN.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Hamblen shows a mastery of detail, and is easy
and fluent in American railwaymen's jargon, much of it more expressive
than polite. His book is well written, instructive, and of thrilling
interest. There are almost a score of capital illustrations."</p>

<p><i>DAILY MAIL.</i>&mdash;"The pages are full of rough, but attractive,
characters, forcible language, brakemen, locomotives, valves, throttles,
levers, and fire-scoops; and the whole dashing record is casually
humorous amid its inevitable brutalities, and is of its kind excellent."</p>

<p><i>ATHENÆUM.</i>&mdash;"The story is vividly told, and decidedly well kept
up with tales of hairbreadth escapes and collisions commendable for
vigour and naturalness.... A book which holds the interest."</p>

<p><i>WORLD.</i>&mdash;"Better worth reading than half the romances published,
for it contains matter that is as interesting as it is absolutely novel."</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"A monstrous entertaining little book. Open it
anywhere and your luck will hardly fail you. And for real gripping
adventure you begin to doubt whether any career is worthy to show
itself in the same caboose with that of an 'engineer.'... His life is as
full of adventure as a pirate's.... A valuable contribution to the
literature that is growing around the Romance of Steam."</p>

<p><i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE</i>.&mdash;"Singularly fascinating. It is just
crammed with moving episodes and hair-raising adventures, all set
down with a vivid and unadorned vigour that is a perfect example of
the art of narration. The pulses quicken, the heart bounds, as we
read."</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"A book to read, and a book to keep after reading.
Mr. Allen's gifts are many&mdash;a style pellucid and picturesque, a vivid and
disciplined power of characterization, and an intimate knowledge of a
striking epoch and an alluring country.... So magical is the wilderness
environment, so fresh the characters, so buoyant the life they lead,
so companionable, so well balanced, and so touched with humanity, the
author's personality, that I hereby send him greeting and thanks for a
brave book.... <cite>The Choir Invisible</cite> is a fine achievement."</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;Mr. Allen's power of character drawing
invests the old, old story with renewed and absorbing interest.... The
fascination of the story lies in great part in Mr. Allen's graceful
and vivid style."</p>

<p><i>DAILY MAIL.</i>&mdash;"<i>The Choir Invisible</i> is one of those very few books
which help one to live. And hereby it is beautiful even more than by
reason of its absolute purity of style, its splendid descriptions of
nature, and the level grandeur of its severe, yet warm and passionate
atmosphere."</p>

<p><i>BRITISH WEEKLY.</i>&mdash;"Certainly this is no commonplace book,
and I have failed to do justice to its beauty, its picturesqueness, its
style, its frequent nobility of feeling, and its large, patient charity."</p>

<p><i>SPEAKER.</i>&mdash;"We trust that there are few who read it who will fail to
regard its perusal as one of the new pleasures of their lives.... One
of those rare stories which make a direct appeal alike to the taste and
feeling of most men and women, and which afford a gratification that
is far greater than that of mere critical approval. It is, in plain
English, a beautiful book&mdash;beautiful in language and in sentiments,
in design and in execution. Its chief merit lies in the fact that
Mr. Allen has grasped the true spirit of historical romance, and has
shown how fully he understands both the links which unite, and the
time-spaces which divide, the different generations of man."</p>

<p><i>SATURDAY REVIEW.</i>&mdash;"Mr. James Lane Allen is a writer who
cannot well put pen to paper without revealing how finely sensitive he
is to beauty."</p>

<p><i>BOOKMAN.</i>&mdash;"The main interest is not the revival of old times, but
a love-story which might be of today, or any day, a story which
reminds one very pleasantly of Harry Esmond and Lady Castlewood."</p>

<p><i>ATLANTIC MONTHLY.</i>&mdash;"We think he will be a novelist, perhaps
even a great novelist&mdash;one of the few who hold large powers of divers
sort in solution to be precipitated in some new unexpected form."</p>

<p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"One of those rare books that will bear reading
many times."</p>

<p><i>DAILY NEWS.</i>&mdash;"Mr. J. L. Allen shows himself a delicate observer,
and a fine literary artist in <cite>The Choir Invisible</cite>."</p>

<p><i>ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"A book that should be read by all
those who ask for something besides sensationalism in their fiction."</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"Marked by beauty of conception, reticence of treatment,
and it has an atmosphere all its own."</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"It is written with singular delicacy and
has an old-world fragrance which seems to come from the classics we
keep in lavender.... There are few who can approach his delicate
execution in the painting of ideal tenderness and fleeting moods."</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
